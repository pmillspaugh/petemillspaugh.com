> If learners spread out their study of a topic, returning to it periodically over time, they remember it better. Similarly, if they interleave the study of different topics, they learn better if they had studied them one at a time in sequence.

The first sentence refers to _spaced repetition_. The second sentence refers to _interleaving_, which will be covered in more depth in a future lesson.

## Mental models

> A mental model is a mental representation of some external reality.

Fitting new knowledge into an existing
mental model or creating a new mental model that connects to another existing one is key for learning.

Placing new knowledge in a larger context aids learning. I've termed this _contextualization_
so that I have a label to attach to the concept, although that's not an official term. Same idea as fitting new
learnings into an existing mental model.

You can fit new knowledge into an existing mental model, and that connection improves retention. Or you might
create a new mental model that connects to another existing mental model.

> All new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge.

Learn the fundamentals!

> Learning always builds on a store of prior knowledge. We interpret and remember events by building connections to what we already know. Long-term memory capacity is virtually limitless: the more you know, the more possible connections you have for adding new knowledge.

Identifying underlying rules helps solve related but unfamiliar problems later.

## Why memory is important

There's a common refrain that rote memorization is not valuable, except maybe in fields like law and medicine
where you need to memorize a high volume of information for ready retrieval on the job. Instead, the argument
goes, we should focus on critical thinking and problem solving. Facts and information are always a quick Google
search away, anyway.

_Make It Stick_ challenges that idea, building a compelling case that memory is crucial for our reasoning ability.

> Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known.
