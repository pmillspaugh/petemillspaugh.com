_Draft:_

`Object.freeze()` makes a JavaScript object immutable.
Once an object is frozen you cannot add properties, update properties, remove properties, or update its prototype.
Freezing the is the highest level of integrity in JavaScript.

Note that the method only applies to top-level properties. To deep freeze an object you would have to recursively call `Object.freeze` on each nested object.
