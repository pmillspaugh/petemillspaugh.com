I don’t work nor think in fiscal quarters, but this clipping happens to cover what I’ve written and read in Q4 2025. And a new job!

## Joining Val Town

I’ve been working for [Val Town](https://val.town) ~one day per week for the past few months. Starting today, I’m officially joining the team as a part-timer—three days a week—while I continue to work on my book the other four. I’ve been a Val Town customer and fan for as long as I’ve been writing in my garden—just hit `cmd+k` and search “Val” on petemillspaugh.com for plenty of evidence there. This very email will be sent using a system I created in Val Town. My excitement for the VT product pretty much boils down to [being into end-user programming](/a-small-matter-of-programming) and working on [end-programmer programming](https://blog.val.town/blog/end-programmer-programming/). That pairs well with my excitement to work with the VT team, whose blog posts always seem to be open in my browser tabs. It’s a good chance to become a better writer and programmer. And as it turns out, I kind of called it in [My next, next, next job](/my-next-next-next-job).

## Writing

I wrote a guest essay for Jane Friedman’s blog: [Write Your Book Like You’d Run a Startup](https://janefriedman.com/write-your-book-like-youd-run-a-startup/). It’s the first time my writing has been published by someone else, and I’m honored that the someone else is Jane Friedman. Jane is the writers’ writer. As I wrote about in [July](/july-2025#a-book), her talk at the Mercantile Library and her book, _The Business of Being a Writer_, planted the idea in my head to write a book of my own.

### Writing from my garden in Q4:

- [The nature of the job](/the-nature-of-the-job)  
  _A cathartic essay about a programmer’s relationship with AI_

  _Skip the list and walk to your local library_
- [Interpreting Crafting Crafting Interpreters](/interpreting-crafting-crafting-interpreters)

- [The couch problem](/the-couch-problem)  
  _On tradeoffs_
- [I’ve been to 39 US states](/39-states)  
  _Green grass and blue skies in Indiana_
- [Programmer-writer](/programmer-writer)  
  _What would you say you do here?_

### Writing for my book in Q4:

- [A Brief History of Domains](https://www.dotcom.press/history-of-domains)  
  _This year, dot com turned 40_
- [You can’t spell Anguilla without AI](https://www.dotcom.press/archive/anguilla)  
  _AI’s economic impact on Anguilla is second to none, but why should we world care?_
- [ICANN is not a boring bureaucracy](https://www.dotcom.press/archive/icann84)  
  _Internet governance drama buried in acronyms_
- [r/domains](https://www.dotcom.press/archive/r-domains)

## Why bother?

I was re-reading Bob Nystrom’s essay, “Crafting \*Crafting Interpreters\*,” about writing his book, _Crafting Interpreters_, and I decided to turn my notes into my own blog post about the blog post: “Interpreting Crafting Crafting Interpreters” (linked above). After writing it, I thought to myself, why do I bother writing this kind of thing? It felt like I’d wasted my time, maybe.

Part of the reason why I’d write something like that is because [a blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query), as Henrik Karlsson wrote. I want to route fascinating people—self-publishing authors—and interesting stuff—books, blogs, ideas—to my inbox. I also want to route recursively-titled meta blog posts to my inbox because I really like this kind of behind-the-scenes, story-of-the-craft writing. Like my friend Danny’s [Making Make a README](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/making-make-a-readme) and Jason Kehe’s [WIRED profile](https://www.wired.com/story/the-tech-worlds-greatest-living-novelist-robin-sloan-goes-meta/) _about profiling_ Robin Sloan, which he almost but didn’t title “The programmer-writer’s programmer-writer.”

Planting blog posts as long, complex search queries is similar to why I’d want a bigger network of friends [on Twitter](/leaving-twitter) and Bluesky. Not for vanity or selling books—although of course that’s nice—but so that I can ask questions and get useful answers that help me find people and their work, like [Steve’s tweet about domain brokers](https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1952835409135947819) that led to three (!) great conversations for my book. I’ve been thinking a lot about getting other people’s antennae up as I write my book. Because I’m writing about domains, [my antenna is up](/on-writing#on-having-your-antenna-up) and ready to notice anything related to domains that I stumble upon. If I can get others’ antennae up, that will route more domain stories to my inbox. That’s (partially) why I send [emails for the book](https://www.dotcom.press/archive) every couple weeks.

I’m also a believer that to write _better_ you need to write _more_. It’s all practice, in a sense. And on that note, please do reply to this email. I’ll write back.
