As of this month, [petemillspaugh.com](https://petemillspaugh.com) is no longer a space for only web dev and adjacent topics. I decided to open it up to all of my writing and projects. I’d originally planned to create a separate blog for such things, but an eventual merge felt inevitable. You can find links to dozens of new, varied notes and essays down below.

This month also marks a new, energizing career direction for me.

## Leaving Membrane

I decided to leave [Membrane](https://membrane.io) to write a book. More on the book in a moment.

I [joined Membrane](/june-2024#joining-membrane) in June of last year. It was a good year! Much of what I wrote about in [My next, next, next job](/my-next-next-next-job) came true, namely learning a lot from a supportive, engaged team with a shared love for programming.

I had the chance to [learn](/june-2024#learning-rust) [a](/hello-rust) [bit](/should-i-learn-computer-science#learning-cs-by-learning-rust) [of](/mandelbrot) [Rust](/rust-raw-strings) working on the Membrane IDE and backend. I enjoyed learning Rust and making my first real code contributions in a programming language other than JavaScript. I also learned that what I really crave and love is the Web platform, i.e. investing fully in JS, HTML, CSS, and Web APIs, which I plan to do more of.

I met many smart people through user interviews and candidate interviews when we were hiring. I got to make some neat Membrane programs for dogfooding and demos. I learned a lot about UX while iterating on our onboarding, documentation, and website. I kept up our weekly(ish) changelog and wrote a handful of blog posts and recorded tutorial videos, like [Testing email verification](https://www.membrane.io/blog/testing-email-verification), [Stripe subscriptions](https://www.membrane.io/blog/stripe-subscription-webhooks), [Slack signup alerts](https://www.membrane.io/blog/slack-signup-alerts), [Hono API sans db](https://www.membrane.io/blog/hono-api), [Public roadmap](http://docs.membrane.io/roadmap), [Automating changelogs](https://www.membrane.io/blog/automating-changelogs), [GitHub issue watcher](https://docs.membrane.io/videos/issue-watcher/) and [PostgreSQL admin dashboard](https://docs.membrane.io/videos/staff-picks/).

It was a worthwhile year, and it wasn’t easy leaving a team that I really liked spending time with. If you’re interested in internal tools, Rust, or graph-based UIs, give Membrane a try and tell [Juan](juan@membrane.io) what you think.

## A book!

I am writing a book about Internet domains: _dot com et al_. The book has its own home on the Web at [dotcom.press](https://dotcom.press). It will cover the history, economics, and artistry of domains.

My _why_ for the book splits roughly into four whys:

1. I love to write, more so over time
2. I’m fascinated by domain names
3. I’m curious about the creative process of self-publishing
4. I’m eager to meet Internet people and hear their domain stories

This is not some lifelong dream realized—it snuck up on me over a couple months until I was too excited not to do it. Back on April 8, I went to an event on a whim at the wonderful [Mercantile Library](https://www.mercantilelibrary.com) for Jane Friedman’s book, [The Business of Being a Writer](/the-business-of-being-a-writer). Hundreds of published and aspiring authors (which did not include me at the time) were in the audience. Jane’s talk was fascinating, covering topics like the staying power of print, traditional publishing deals versus self-publishing, and building your platform in walled gardens like Twitter and Substack versus your own website/newsletter. After the event I started reading my freshly signed copy of Jane’s book, sometimes applying her lessons to my own experience as a blogger, but mostly reading out of detached curiosity. _This is super interesting, but I’m not going to write a book. What would I even write about?_ That is, until it clicked. Domains!

Domains is the subject I kept coming back to. I’ve written a few wandering, wondering notes in my garden: [dot com et al](/dot-com) (where I borrowed the working title of the book), [Silly TLDs](/silly-tlds), and [Serious TLDs](/serious-tlds). I own nearly two dozen domains, many of which were gifts to friends and family. I want everyone to have their own corner of the Internet, and that starts with a domain. I’m interested in topics like how registrars work, creating new gTLDs, geopolitic risk around ccTLDs, customer trust w/r/t unusual TLDs, investing in domains, pricing domains, legal battles, and branding centered around a domain name. The book won’t be technical, but I anticipate that it will naturally appeal more to programmers and other Web-interested people.

I’m also quite excited for what a book entails outside of the writing itself. The barrier to self-publishing is low these days, and I see it as a deeply creative process. There may even be a timeline where I extend my newly established publishing company, [Dot Com Press, LLC](https://dotcom.press), to publish books for others. I plan to build interactive elements on the book’s website and publish across many formats: the expected ones like print, ebook, and audiobook, but also serialized as a podcast and email newsletter with one chapter per week.

Probably the most fun I’ll have along the way will be interviewing people. Pretty much anyone who’s worked around the Web has some story to tell or article to share about a domain. On that note, **reply to this email!** Interviews can be as informal as you’d like, from casually brainstorming to recording a story that ends up as its own book chapter.

This isn’t a transition away from web development, either. I want to code more, if anything. I don’t know if I’ll write another book after this, but I do expect to keep coding as my Main Thing, and that excites me.

## What I’m reading

I’ve read some great books in 2025 (and some just-ok ones). Some of these can be found on my brand new [bookshelf](/bookshelf).

- [The Business of Being a Writer by Jane Friedman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219627375-the-business-of-being-a-writer-second-edition): 5/5. For writers, bloggers, and anyone curious about publishing. [My notes](/the-business-of-being-a-writer).

- [North by Scott Jurek](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34219858-north): 3/5. For runners and (AT) hikers. [My notes](/north).
- [Kitchen Confidential](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33313.Kitchen_Confidential): 2/5. For foodies. [My notes](/kitchen-confidential).
- [Breath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48890486-breath): 2/5. For anyone, I guess. [My notes](/breath).
- [Word By Word by Kory Stamper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30781490-word-by-word): 5/5. For word nerds. If you like _Authority and American Usage_ by David Foster Wallace, I bet you’ll like this. Whimsically written, and full of new words (unsurprisingly).
- [Where You’ll Find Me by Ty Gagne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36019816-where-you-ll-find-me): 5/5. For hikers, skiers, White Mountaineers. I also recommend [The Last Traverse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55946570-the-last-traverse), which I listened to.
- [Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead): 5/5. For Dickens readers. Sad but well done, like many of my favorite books and movies.
- [Rise of the Ultra Runners by Adharanand Finn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41817453-the-rise-of-the-ultra-runners): 4/5. For runners. An intro and who’s who of ultra running, and a natural follow-up to _Born to Run_ and Scott Jurek’s books.
- [Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58065033-lessons-in-chemistry): 3/5. For (allies of) women in STEM. I liked the premise, story, and messaging, but I wasn’t as much a fan of the prose.
- [My Brilliant Friend](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend): 3/5. For fiction readers. I read the translation, and I think it was both well written and had a good narrative, yet for whatever reason it wasn’t the right book at the right time for me.
- [Marathon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171497800-marathon-by-higdon-hal-4th-fourth-edition): 2/5. For marathoners. A fairly dry and somewhat outdated practical guide, but still worthwhile if you’re into marathon running.

## What I’m writing

Outside of books I’m reading and the book I’m writing, I’ve planted notes here and there in my garden.
