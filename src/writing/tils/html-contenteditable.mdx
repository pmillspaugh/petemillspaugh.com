While working on [weeksofyour.life](https://weeksofyour.life), I experimented with HTML [`contenteditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable).

It can be set to `"true"` or an empty string to make an element editable, `"false"` (default) to disable editing, or `"plaintext-only"` to enable plaintext editing only. The rich text editing is actually very cool, I think. Play around with the demo below.

<h2 contentEditable="true">Demo</h2>

<span contentEditable="true">
  Try editing this paragraph and its heading! You can **bold**, _italicize_, or{" "}
  <u>underline</u> text. You can even add emojis like this: ðŸ¥ž
</span>
