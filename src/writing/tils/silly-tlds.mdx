I’ve known there are a bunch of novel TLDs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" target="_blank">top-level domains</a>) since the first time I bought a domain, but I didn’t quite appreciate the extent of it until seeing <a href="https://porkbun.com/awesome" target="_blank">porkbun.com/awesome</a>.

<Figure.Porkbun />

Lots of them are very specific—like `.coffee` or `.cafe` for a coffee shop—which I find very satisfying. But then some are downright goofy. I mean, `.bob_ross`?? There are 424 options on porkbun, by my count. I only screenshotted a small subset.

The history of TLDs is interesting. For example, I heard on a <a href="https://syntax.fm" target="_blank">syntax.fm</a> podcast (I can’t remember which episode, but that’s a great use of `.fm`) that Anguila now has a pretty significant revenue stream from their `.ai` ending.

The most fun TLD I’ve actually used is <a href="https://www.pete.football" target="_blank">pete.football</a>. I did own a `.band` domain at one point when my friend asked me to make a website for his band, but sadly he moved to LA and the band split up. Looking at these gets my wheels turning, though. I already have somewhat of a compulsive domain buying habit, so this makes things much harder. Like, I could move this very website to `pete.garden`, or someone could build an interactive version of <em>Where’s Waldo</em> at `wheres.waldo`.

I love coming across uncommon TLDs, like <a href="https://standup.nyc" target="_blank">standup.nyc</a>, <a href="https://neal.fun" target="_blank">neal.fun</a>, <a href="https://same.energy" target="_blank">same.energy</a>, <a href="https://emoji.supply/kitchen" target="_blank">emoji.supply/kitchen</a>, and <a href="https://radio.garden" target="_blank">radio.garden</a>. Another cool use case is endings that complete a name, like <a href="https://ped.ro/" target="_blank">ped.ro</a> and <a href="https://tolin.ski/" target="_blank">tolin.ski</a>.
