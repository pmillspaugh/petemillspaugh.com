To represent edited text in HTML, there are a few semantically distinct options.

The `<s>` <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s" target="_blank">strikethrough element</a> is for text that’s “no longer relevant or no longer accurate” and is “not appropriate when indicating document edits”. E.g., Wool socks: <s>$12</s> <em>$8</em>

The `<del>` <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del" target="_blank">deleted text element</a> is for “text that has been deleted from a document”, and the `<ins>` <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins" target="_blank">inserted text element</a> is for “text that has been inserted into a document”.

There’s also a deprecated <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strike" target="_blank">`<strike>`</a> element that was a catch-all for the visual strikethrough effect.

To accelerate these sorts of semantic HTML discoveries, I’ve been meaning to read Patrick Weaver’s <a href="https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/" target="_blank">Blog Post With Every HTML Element</a> from a few months ago. There’s also the <a href="https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023" target="_blank">State of HTML 2023</a>, which I'm hoping will be as much learning as it is survey-answering.
