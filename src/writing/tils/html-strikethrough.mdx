To represent edited text in HTML, there are a few semantically distinct options.

The [`<s>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s) strikethrough element is for text that’s “no longer relevant or no longer accurate” and is “not appropriate when indicating document edits.” E.g., Wool socks: <s>$12</s> <em>$8</em>. The [`<del>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del) deleted text element is for “text that has been deleted from a document,” and the [`<ins>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins) inserted text element is for “text that has been inserted into a document.” There’s also a deprecated [`<strike>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strike) element that was a catch-all for the visual strikethrough effect.

To accelerate these sorts of semantic HTML discoveries, I’ve been meaning to read Patrick Weaver’s [Blog Post With Every HTML Element](https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/) from a few months ago. There’s also the [State of HTML 2023](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023), which I'm hoping will be as much learning as it is survey-answering.
