Raw strings in Rust are a nicely designed language feature. From the O'Reilly book, [_Programming Rust_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25550614-programming-rust) (emphasis mine):

> Rust "raw string" syntax: the letter r, zero or more hash marks (that is, the # character), a double quote, and then the contents of the string, terminated by another double quote followed by the same number of hash marks. Any character may occur within a raw string without being escaped, including double quotes; in fact, no escape sequences like `\"` are recognized. **We can always ensure the string ends where we intend by using more hash marks around the quotes than ever appear in the text.**

So, for example:

```rs main.rs
fn get_docs_link() -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse::Ok().content_type("text/html").body(
        r##"<a href="/docs#getting-started">Go to docs</a>"##,
    )
}
```

Writing the HTML as a raw string would be less readable:

```rs main.rs
"<a href=\"/docs#getting-started\">Go to docs</a>"
```

I think the use-as-many-hashtags-as-you-need rule is pretty clever.
