I stumbled upon some special characters available at armâ€™s length while writing my Brainstorm on <a href="/map-in-the-woods" target="_blank">downloading a map in the woods</a>.

You can find all sorts of symbols by pressing `âŒƒâŒ˜Space` and scrolling down past the emojis:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ul style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
  <li>âœ¦ Nice symbols for bullet point alternatives, like `âœ§` and `âœ“`</li>
  <li>âœ¦ Handy things that you might actually use with some frequency, like `78ÂºF` and `Bingoâ„¢`</li>
  <li>âœ¦ Keyboard icons, like the command key `âŒ˜` that I used above</li>
  <li>âœ¦ Random characters, like chess pieces `â™œ`, cards `ðŸ‚¡`, and dice `âš‚`</li>
</ul>

I use this keyboard shortcut most often for emojis, but these special characters are a fun Easter egg.
