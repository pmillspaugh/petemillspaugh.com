I stumbled upon some special characters available at arm’s length while writing my Brainstorm on <Link href="/map-in-the-woods" target="_blank">downloading a map in the woods</Link>.

You can find all sorts of symbols by pressing `⌃⌘Space` and scrolling down past the emojis:

- ✦ Nice symbols for bullet point alternatives, like `✧` and `✓`
- ✦ Handy things you might actually use with some frequency, like `78ºF` and `Bingo™`
- ✦ Keyboard icons, like the command key `⌘` that I used above
- ✦ Random characters, like chess pieces `♜`, cards `🂡`, and dice `⚂`

<br />

I use this keyboard shortcut most often for emojis, but these special characters are a fun Easter egg.
