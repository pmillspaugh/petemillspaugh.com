I stumbled upon some special characters available at armâ€™s length while writing my Brainstorm on <Link href="/map-in-the-woods" target="_blank">downloading a map in the woods</Link>.

You can find all sorts of symbols by pressing `âŒƒâŒ˜Space` and scrolling down past the emojis:

- Nice symbols for bullet point alternatives, like `âœ§` and `âœ“`
- Handy things you might actually use with some frequency, like `78ÂºF` and `Bingoâ„¢`
- Keyboard icons, like the command key `âŒ˜` that I used above
- Random characters, like chess pieces `â™œ`, cards `ðŸ‚¡`, and dice `âš‚`

<br />

I use this keyboard shortcut most often for emojis, but these special characters are a fun Easter egg.
