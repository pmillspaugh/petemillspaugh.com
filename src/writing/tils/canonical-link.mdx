I was talking to a coworker today who mentioned that he wrote some blog posts for LogRocket. He also published each post to his personal blog, like [this one on Web Workers](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/how-to-improve-interface-responsiveness-with-web-workers). To allot proper credit and SEO preference to LogRocket, he adds a canonical link in the HTML head of each post, like this:

```html
<link
  rel="canonical"
  href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-improve-interface-responsiveness-with-web-workers/"
/>
```

From the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel):

> `canonical`
>
> Valid for [`<link>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), it defines the preferred URL for the current document, which helps search engines reduce duplicate content.

The [Google Search developer docs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls#reasons-to-specify-a-canonical-url) go deeper on the why and how of canonical links. Another interesting use case is to simplify tracking metrics for duplicate URLs on the same website.

_And btw, [Dannyâ€™s blog](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog) is worth a follow!_
