{/* TODO: make sure Danny is ok with me linking to his post */}
I was talking to a coworker today who mentioned that he wrote some blog posts for LogRocket. He also published each post to his personal blog, like <a href="https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/how-to-improve-interface-responsiveness-with-web-workers" target="_blank">this one on Web Workers</a>. To allot proper credit and SEO preference to LogRocket, he adds a canonical link in the HTML head of each post, like this:

{/* TODO: code blocks need horizontal scroll to prevent overflow */}

```html
<link
  rel="canonical"
  href="https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-improve-interface-responsiveness-with-web-workers/"
/>
```

<a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel"
  target="_blank"
>
  Per MDN:
</a>

{/* TODO: blockquote splitting up children into two paragraphs? */}

> canonical
> Valid for `<link>`, it defines the preferred URL for the current document, which helps search engines reduce duplicate content.

The <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls#reasons-to-specify-a-canonical-url" target="_blank">Google Search developer docs</a> go deeper on the why and how of canonical links. Another interesting use case is to simplify tracking metrics for duplicate URLs on the same website.
