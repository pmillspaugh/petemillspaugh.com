The CSS [`revert-layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert-layer) keyword allows you to reset a property’s value to that of the previous cascade layer. I wouldn’t have understood that sentence this morning, so I’ll break it down.

`revert-layer` is a keyword you can use for a property’s value, like [`inherit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit), [`initial`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial), [`unset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unset), or [`revert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert). Contrast those with other values like `8px`, `1rem`, or `100%`. You can even apply these to all properties at once with the `all` shorthand property:

```css styles.css
button {
  all: unset;
}
```

I think it’s helpful to understand the `revert` keyword before understanding `revert-layer`. When you use `revert`, the property will fall back to its value in the previous [style origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Style_origin). What’s a style origin?

## Style origins

There are three style origins: user agent origin (i.e. browser defaults), user origin (does anyone do that anymore?), and author origin (i.e. styles written by you the developer). So in most cases `revert` probably falls back to a browser default, meaning it’s often the same result as using `unset`.

`revert-layer`, on the other hand, allows you to fall back to the previous _author origin_ cascade layer. But what’s a cascade layer?

## Cascade layers

CSS [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers) define the prioritization of styles from different sources. Within each layer, specificity rules apply. You’ve probably seen the [`!important`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important) keyword, for example, which allows a declaration to jump up the priority ladder to a higher cascade layer. And you probably know intuitively that author origin styles are in a higher priority cascade layer than user agent styles. You can explicitly create cascade layers using [`@layer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) syntax to separate the priority of different style sources in your app.

## I almost used this in production

I came across `revert-layer` while working on [ide.membrane.io](https://ide.membrane.io) today. We have a global stylesheet used for auth pages, and we don’t want those styles to apply to the root IDE page (which is a vscode fork with its own styles). When redirecting to the IDE from an auth page, though, that global stylesheet has already loaded. So I thought this would be a perfect case to write something like:

```css app/global.css
@layer base {
  /* Global styles for auth pages here... */

  .ide * {
    all: revert-layer;
  }
}
```

It didn’t work as smoothly as I’d hoped in this case (the vscode codebase has many, many CSS files plus inline HTML and JS-controlled styles, so it was tricky to figure out exactly what’s being applied, and visually testing the whole surface of the editor is next to impossible). I ended up using Next.js [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups) with different layouts instead, but hopefully the `revert-layer` side quest was worthwhile.
