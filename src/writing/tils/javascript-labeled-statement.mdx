> Nested loops aren’t ideal, but sometimes they’re unavoidable. Given the nested loop below, how can we break out of the nested loop when `j === 2`?

```js loop.js
function loop() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
      if (j === 2) {
        // Break out here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The tl;dr is that you can label the outer for loop:

```js labeledLoop.js
function loop() {
  dance: for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
      if (j === 2) {
        break dance;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can only use [statement labels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label) with `break` and `continue`, which I don't find myself using too often to begin with. You can't even console log a label—I tried, and it throws `Uncaught ReferenceError: <label> is not defined`.

I'll admit that I actually learned about labeled statements a year or two ago when reviewing a coworker's PR, but I haven't come across one since. I think it's a neat language feature to stash in my back pocket.
