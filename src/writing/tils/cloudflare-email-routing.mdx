[Cloudflare email routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/) makes it trivial to stand up an email address on your custom domain. I wanted to set up `pete@petemillspaugh.com` (send me an email!) to forward to my personal email address, and it literally took ~3 minutes of button clicking.

I’m already a happy customer of Cloudflare’s domain registry, which doesn’t mark up domain prices and comes with all the expected stuff (e.g. SSL). Email routing doesn’t support _replying_ from that custom address out of the box, but you can do other cool stuff like custom processing logic in a Cloudflare Worker and analytics.
