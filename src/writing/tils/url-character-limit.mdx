I was curious how much state I could actually store in a serverless, shareable way for a tiny weekend project I’m thinking about. The **TL;DR is that you should keep URLs under 2000 characters to be safe, or 8000 if you don’t care about search engines**.

Internet Explorer used to be the limiting factor because it only supported 2083 chars, but modern browsers can handle up to ~8000 bytes. From [HTTP RFC 9110, section 4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.1-5) (2022):

> It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.

URLs use [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), so it’s not quite 1 byte per character, e.g. an underscore `_` would be percent-encoded as `%5F`, requiring 3 bytes. You can even include emojis in URLs, although that may not be the best idea—[especially in a domain name](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/idn-emojis-domain-names-13feb19-en.pdf).

For search engine compatibility, the [sitemaps protocol](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) defines a 2048-character URL limit. CDNs also may have limits, and there’s even a status code for exceeding the limit: [HTTP 414 URI Too Long](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/414).

I mainly sourced this from a [really good answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184) from Paul Dixon on Stack Overflow that he’s been updating for over 14 years now.
