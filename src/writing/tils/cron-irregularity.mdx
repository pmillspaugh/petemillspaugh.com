There isnâ€™t just one universal standard for cron expression syntax, as far as I can tell.

I noticed because the widely-used [`cron`](https://crates.io/crates/cron) Rust crate (>2M downloads) that we use at [Membrane](https://membrane.io) includes a seconds field and handles day of week differently from the syntax I'm used to.

Or maybe there is an agreed-upon standard? The cron Wikipedia page has a section on ["Nonstandard predefined scheduling definitions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Nonstandard_predefined_scheduling_definitions), which implies there are standard predefined scheduling definitions. And from the [mcron man pages via gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/mcron/manual/html_node/Crontab-file.html):

> The format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard...The time and date fields are:

```
Field             Allowed values
--------------------------------
minute            0-59
hour              0-23
day of month      0-31
month             0-12 (or names, see below)
day of week       0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
```

## cron tl;dr

`cron` is a CLI and job scheduler for Unix-like OSs. `crontab` (cron table) files run shell commands on a schedule (colloquially, "cron jobs"). The cron daemon wakes up every minute, reads crontab files, and executes commands as appropriate.
