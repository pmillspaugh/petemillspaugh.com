While working on [weeksofyour.life](https://weeksofyour.life), I experimented with the CSS [`ch`](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2018/06/28/what-is-the-css-ch-unit/) unit.

From the spec, ch units are:

> Equal to the used advance measure of the “0” (ZERO, U+0030) glyph found in the font used to render it. (The advance measure of a glyph is its advance width or height, whichever is in the inline axis of the element.)
