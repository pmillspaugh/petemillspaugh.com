I’ve been using the [CSS nesting selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector), `&`, for a few years to nest style declarations. I wondered recently if you even need it. For example:

```css styles.css
button {
  &:hover {
    shadow: 2px 2px black;
  }

  :hover {
    shadow: 2px 2px black;
  }
}
```

The above CSS declarations are equivalent to:

```css styles.css
button:hover {
  shadow: 2px 2px black;
}

button *:hover {
  shadow: 2px 2px black;
}
```

Using the ampersand directly appends the selector that follows to the parent selector. So instead of matching the `:hover` state of _all_ button children, we can use `&` to match hovering just the button itself.

So you do need it sometimes (which, like, why would it exist if you didn’t need it sometimes, I guess).
