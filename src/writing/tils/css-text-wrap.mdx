I am always irked by the last word of a sentence or heading wrapping onto the next line. I even edit texts before I send them to avoid it ðŸ˜…. [`text-wrap: pretty`](https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/css-text-wrap-pretty/) is what Iâ€™ve been waiting for!

Iâ€™ve manually added `nbsp;` in the past a handful of times, but thatâ€™s a bad solution for a few reasons: it isnâ€™t responsiveâ€”you canâ€™t control which viewports will cause orphans or know when users will zoom/update their base font size; itâ€™s rather manualâ€”youâ€™d have to update every time you change copy; and itâ€™s not semantic, which may harm accessibility.

Thereâ€™s also `text-wrap: balance`, which distributes words evenly across lines. I am using that declaration for headings.

```css styles.css
p {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}

h1 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

The browser support [isnâ€™t perfect](https://caniuse.com/?search=css%20text-wrap%20pretty), but the fallback is just the status quo, so itâ€™s safe to use.

If youâ€™d like to dig deeper, thereâ€™s a [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJFD8nAUuiUX6ArFZQqQo8yTsvg8IuAq7oFrNQxPeqI) written by the engineer who designed this, Koji Ishii.
