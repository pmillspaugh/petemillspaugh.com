> **Update**: after I started using `all: unset`, I realized that the convenience tradeoff is probably not worth the danger and loss of precision. For example, the button code snippet below also removes default `outline` styles, which harms accessibility (and UX for all users). The more CSS I write, the more inclined I am to avoid shorthand properties that abstract away what properties the declaration sets. E.g. itâ€™s more deliberate to declare `animation-delay`, `animation-duration`, etc. separately than to use the `animation` shorthand.

To reset a CSS property to its default value, you can use the `unset` value. And to unset all properties at once, you can use `all: unset`:

```css styles.css
button {
  all: unset;
}
```

That saves a couple lines from the alternative:

```css styles.css
button {
  padding: 0;
  border: none;
  background-color: transparent;
}
```

I find myself doing the latter pretty often, so this should save a couple lines many times over.
