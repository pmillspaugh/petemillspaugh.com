To reset a CSS property to its default value, you can use the `unset` value:

```css styles.css
button {
  all: unset;
}
```

That saves a couple lines from the alternative:

```css styles.css
button {
  padding: 0;
  border: none;
  background-color: transparent;
}
```

I find myself doing the latter pretty often, so this will save a couple lines many times over.
