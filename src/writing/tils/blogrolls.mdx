I just learned the word “blogroll”—first seen on [Manu Moreale’s blog](https://manuelmoreale.com/blogroll). I added mine at <Link href="/blogroll">/blogroll</Link>. I don’t know if this is one of those _omg-how-did-I-go-so-long-without-knowing-that_ things, or if it’s just an early web blogosphere thing I missed.

I think they’ve probably gone out of fashion because the Google search results for “blogroll” are mostly websites with mid 2000s aesthetics. [From O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/think-before-you/9781118018811/ch005-sec027.html):

> A blogroll is a list of links to blogs that the blogger likes. A blogroll is usually included in the blog’s sidebar. Some bloggers split their blogrolls into categories.

I’d like them to come back into fashion. When I discover an amazing new (to me) blog/person and go on a reading spree of their website, chances are I’d also like whoever they like. It would be a great thread to pull. Or maybe it would just be lots of open browser tabs.
