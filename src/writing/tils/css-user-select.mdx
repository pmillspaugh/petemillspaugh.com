I came across [`user-select`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select) in the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) codebase. You can set `user-select: none`, for example, to prevent text selection.

In most cases, its value is `text`. The exceptions are `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements and any element whose parent with `user-select: <none|all>`.

Setting `user-select: all` on an element means that selecting any of its descendents will select _all_ text in that element and its descendents. I’m not sure when I’d use that, though, because it prevents more granular selection of text.
