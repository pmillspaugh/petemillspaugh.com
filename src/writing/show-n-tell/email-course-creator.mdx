I recently read [_Make It Stick_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick), a book written by cognitive psychologists about effective learning techniques, backed by research. One of the topics covered is [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), which I <Link href="/anki" target="_blank">started practicing in my own learning</Link> this summer using flashcard software [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

While reading, I was reminded of [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/), which I took as an email-based course in beta before its full launch as a web application (amazing course btw, for anyone who wants to strengthen their JavaScript mental models). Spaced repetition is key to learning, and email can be a great medium to naturally bake in time between lessons.

## Email course creation tool

With all that in mind, I made an email course creator using [val.town](https://www.val.town/) that anyone who knows some JavaScript and HTML can fork to create their own email-based course. Along with spaced repetition, I lean on other effective learning techniques from the book to inform course structure:

- Fill-in-the-blank before each lesson as _generation_
- Mixing up order of content as _interleaving_
- Quizzing as _retrieval practice_
- Free form writing at the end of each lesson as _elaboration_ and _reflection_

As an example (and hopefully a useful resource), I used the course creator to write a course about learning techniques and research covered in _Make It Stick_. And if you're interested in Val Town, I also wrote about <Link href="/val-town-button" target="_blank">creating a global button</Link> and <Link href="/cultivating-emails" target="_blank">managing email subscribers</Link>.

## Signup Vals

For signup and email verification, I forked the Val that I wrote for `petemillspaugh.com` subscribers (signup for that is in the footer). I added a root endpoint `/` that returns a signup form for the course, which you can test out in the Val embed preview below. I also set up a <Link href="/make-it-stick" target="_blank">landing page for the course</Link> that hits the same verification endpoints. I cover signup/verfication in more detail in my <Link href="/cultivating-emails">Show 'n Tell on cultivating emails</Link>, but here's the code for reference:

## Cron Val for daily email lesson

TODO.
