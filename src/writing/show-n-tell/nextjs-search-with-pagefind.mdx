[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) is a neat open source client-side search library. From the docs:

> Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your users’ bandwidth as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure.

The docs do a terrific job explaining things, and the search UX feels really snappy (hit `cmd/ctrl+k` to test it out). To get Pagefind working with Next.js, it takes a few extra steps.

## Run pagefind after build

Start by installing Pagefind as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm i -D pagefind
```

The Pagefind CLI generates a static search index from your site’s static files after building. The [`--site`](https://pagefind.app/docs/config-options/#site) flag indicates the output directory of your built static files, and the [`--output-path`](https://pagefind.app/docs/config-options/#output-path) option is where the search bundle will be written.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build",
    "postbuild": "pagefind --site .next --output-path .next/static/chunks/pages/pagefind"
  }
}
```

I initially wrote these instructions for Next v13.4.9 using the pages router, but I've also set up Pagefind for Next v15.3.4 using the app router—just swap out `/pages` for `/app` in the postbuild script.

On this site I’m using pnpm, which [doesn’t support](https://pnpm.io/cli/run#differences-with-npm-run) `pre-` and `post-` scripts by default, so I just appended the script to my build command using the `&&` operator. You can also [enable pre- and post- scripts](https://pnpm.io/cli/run#enable-pre-post-scripts) with pnpm. Depending on how you build and deploy, you might be able to avoid adding the dependency and postbuild script altogether by running `npx pagefind` instead.

## Dynamically import search bundle

A couple tricky wrinkles to handle are (1) handling errors in development, and (2) configuring Webpack to allow the import to resolve correctly.

The first one is an issue because the Pagefind search index is generated _after_ build, so it doesn’t exist when running `next dev`. One way to solve this is creating a `/pagefind/pagefind.js` file that returns some mock search results in development, or you can add a try-catch and `@ts-expect-error` comment to avoid creating the extra file ([thanks to noxify](https://github.com/pmillspaugh/petemillspaugh.com/pull/15#discussion_r1371544139) for the tip!).

The second problem is that Webpack will bundle `/pagefind/pagefind.js` and output the contents into a new file, so the import path will hit a dead end. That’s where the [`webpackIgnore`](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#webpackignore) comment comes in handy, preserving the initial path. Files in the `/pages` directory will end up in the `.next/static/chunks/pages` folder upon build, and `/app` router files will end up in `.next/static/chunks/app`.

```tsx
export default function SearchPage() {
  const [query, setQuery] = React.useState("");
  const [results, setResults] = React.useState([]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function loadPagefind() {
      if (typeof window.pagefind === "undefined") {
        try {
          window.pagefind = await import(
            // @ts-expect-error pagefind.js generated after build
            /* webpackIgnore: true */ "./pagefind/pagefind.js"
          );
        } catch (e) {
          // Empty or dummy results for local dev
          window.pagefind = { search: () => ({ results: [] }) };
        }
      }
    }
    loadPagefind();
  }, []);

  async function handleSearch() {
    if (window.pagefind) {
      const search = await window.pagefind.search(query);
      setResults(search.results);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search..."
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        onInput={handleSearch}
      />
      <div id="results">
        {results.map((result, index) => (
          <Result key={result.id} result={result} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function Result({ result }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [path, setPath] = useState("");

  React.useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      const data = await result.data();
      setData(data);

      const normalized = data.url
        .replace(/^\/_next\/static\/chunks\/app\/server\/app/, "")
        .replace(/\.html$/, "");
      setPath(normalized);
    }
    fetchData();
  }, [result]);

  if (!data) return null;

  return (
    <Link href={path}>
      <h3>{data.meta.title}</h3>
      <p>{data.excerpt}</p>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

The search implementation on this website is [public](https://github.com/pmillspaugh/petemillspaugh.com), as is [my book website's source code](https://github.com/pmillspaugh/dotcom.press), so feel free to poke around (and suggest anything I could improve upon).

## Bells ’n whistles

Pagefind exposes some handy options for refining your index and polishing search UI. I am using both the [`data-pagefind-body`](https://pagefind.app/docs/indexing/#limiting-what-sections-of-a-page-are-indexed) and [`data-pagefind-ignore`](https://pagefind.app/docs/indexing/#removing-individual-elements-from-the-index) attributes to exclude certain content from my search index (e.g. header, 404 page, homepage, etc.).

You can also swap out [`pagefind.debouncedSearch()`](https://pagefind.app/docs/api/#debounced-search) in place of the standard `pagefind.search()` to cut down on resource usage and prevent jarring flashes of results before you finish typing a search query. I used to do this, but I’ve since moved camps.

There are options to [filter](https://pagefind.app/docs/api/#filtering) and [sort](https://pagefind.app/docs/api/#sorting-results) results, too, which I may tap into down the road. Check out the docs for other neat options, like [multilingual support](https://pagefind.app/docs/multilingual/).

## Shoutouts

Thanks to [Otterlord’s blog post](https://blog.otterlord.dev/posts/astro-search/) on using Pagefind with Astro for the nudge to share something similar for Next. If you’re keen to use Pagefind with another SSG, the docs have a list of [community resources](https://pagefind.app/docs/resources/). There are also some nice [demos](https://pagefind.app/#pagefind-demos) to get a feel for the search experience before jumping into your own implementation.

And big, big thanks to [bglw](https://github.com/bglw) for helping me debug this and creating an amazing library!
