[Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170548.Don_t_Sweat_the_Small_Stuff_and_It_s_All_Small_Stuff) is the first self-help book I ever read, about ten years ago. I loved it then and I loved it now. The subtitle is: _…and it’s all small stuff._ That’s not true—it’s not all small stuff, but this type of stuff is around us all the time. It’s a pithy title. I like it. I like the book. And the small stuff does matter.

The book has dozens of relatively simple mindset shifts that can drastically improve everyday life. The example chapter I always bring up when recommending the book to people is, “When you don’t know whose turn it is to take out the trash, take out the trash.”
