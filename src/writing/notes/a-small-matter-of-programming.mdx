I am reading [_A Small Matter of Programming_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/581700.A_Small_Matter_of_Programming) by Bonnie Nardi with some others in the <Link href="foc-book-club" target="_blank">Future of Coding book club</Link>.

## On what end users care about versus what programmers care about (xii, 5)

{/* TODO: */}

> ...users who have little or no training in computer science, and often little interest in computers per se. Most end users regard computers as useful—even indispensable—machines capable of helping them work more productively, creatively, and with greater pleasure. This is not the same as finding computers themselves intrinsically interesting—as a computer scientist or engineer would—and it dictates an entirely different set of tools for end users.

Timeless reminder that users don’t care about our tech stack. They don’t care that I’m using Remix instead of Next, or Svelte or Astro or whatever. The thing that always sticks in my mind is Jerome Hardaway saying that users only care if your website (1) works, (2) is fast, and (3) looks good. In that order, too.

End users want computers to get work done. Programmers like computers because programming is fun and interesting.

I definitely feel this when showing websites to friends and family. The way I navigate a website is often quite different from the way someone who doesn't create websites for a living does.

The thing I heard Jerome Hardaway say when I was first learning to code comes to mind: people care if your website (1) works, (2) is fast, and (3) looks good. In that order, too.

> A user of a software system was heard to remark, "I didn't have much time, so I did it the long way."
> ...
> The converse of the statement, putatively from a collection of MIT graffiti, goes: “I would rather write programs to help me write programs than write programs.”

That's not to say end users aren't sophisticated, though.

> End users are not "casual", "novice" or "naive" users; they are people such as chemists, librarians, teachers, architects, and accountants, who have computational needs and want to make serious use of computers, but who are not interested in becoming professional programmers.

## On design (6)

> Of course design still is, and almost certainly always will be, a black art whose most crucial elements remain an incalculable mix of imagination, intuition, and intellectual interaction with one’s fellows.

this resonates. not sure if she's talking about visual design or the design of a program overall. holding the thing in your hands (i.e. using it) collaboration with teammates, and user interviews unlock design ideas

## On spreadsheets (7-8)

{/* TODO: probably move this to a different section where the spreadsheet studies are more in-depth. She just introduces them here */}

Nardi draws from two ethnographic studies she did in 1990 and 1991 with spreadsheet users.

Discussion of spreadsheets hits home for me since I worked in investment banking briefly before becoming a programmer, which meant spending 8-16+ hours a day in Microsoft Excel. I was floored by how bad our version control system was. We basically just versioned up the file whenever it felt like a good breaking point, so you'd end up with files like `shopify_v346.xlsx`. Even worse, two people couldn't reasonably work on the same model simultaneously without branching and merge conflict resolution etc. Version control with git was one of the happiest discoveries for me when I started coding.

When I was learning to program I noted the similarities between Excel and JavaScript—circular dependencies, modularizing programs, readability, etc.
