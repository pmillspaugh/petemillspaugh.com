I am reading [_A Small Matter of Programming_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/581700.A_Small_Matter_of_Programming) by Bonnie Nardi with some others in the <Link href="foc-book-club" target="_blank">Future of Coding book club</Link>.

It's amazing how current this book reads even though it was published over 30 years ago in 1993. That was only two years after the [world's first website](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) and two years _before_ JavaScript was invented.

## On what end users care about versus what programmers care about (xii, 5)

{/* TODO: */}

> ...users who have little or no training in computer science, and often little interest in computers per se. Most end users regard computers as useful—even indispensable—machines capable of helping them work more productively, creatively, and with greater pleasure. This is not the same as finding computers themselves intrinsically interesting—as a computer scientist or engineer would—and it dictates an entirely different set of tools for end users.

Timeless reminder that users don’t care about our tech stack. They don’t care that I’m using Remix instead of Next, or Svelte or Astro or whatever. The thing that always sticks in my mind is Jerome Hardaway saying that users only care if your website (1) works, (2) is fast, and (3) looks good. In that order, too.

End users want computers to get work done. Programmers like computers because programming is fun and interesting.

I definitely feel this when showing websites to friends and family. The way I navigate a website is often quite different from the way someone who doesn't create websites for a living does.

The thing I heard Jerome Hardaway say when I was first learning to code comes to mind: people care if your website (1) works, (2) is fast, and (3) looks good. In that order, too.

> A user of a software system was heard to remark, "I didn't have much time, so I did it the long way."
> ...
> The converse of the statement, putatively from a collection of MIT graffiti, goes: “I would rather write programs to help me write programs than write programs.”

That's not to say end users aren't sophisticated, though.

> End users are not "casual", "novice" or "naive" users; they are people such as chemists, librarians, teachers, architects, and accountants, who have computational needs and want to make serious use of computers, but who are not interested in becoming professional programmers.

## On design (6)

> Of course design still is, and almost certainly always will be, a black art whose most crucial elements remain an incalculable mix of imagination, intuition, and intellectual interaction with one’s fellows.

{/* TODO: */}
this resonates. not sure if she's talking about visual design or the design of a program overall. holding the thing in your hands (i.e. using it) collaboration with teammates, and user interviews unlock design ideas

## On spreadsheets (7-8)

{/* TODO: probably move this to a different section where the spreadsheet studies are more in-depth. She just introduces them here */}

Nardi draws from two ethnographic studies she did in 1990 and 1991 with spreadsheet users.

Discussion of spreadsheets hits home for me since I worked in investment banking briefly before becoming a programmer, which meant spending 8-16+ hours a day in Microsoft Excel. I was floored by how bad our version control system was. We basically just versioned up the file whenever it felt like a good breaking point, so you'd end up with files like `shopify_v346.xlsx`. Even worse, two people couldn't reasonably work on the same model simultaneously without branching and merge conflict resolution etc. Version control with git was one of the happiest discoveries for me when I started coding.

When I was learning to program I noted the similarities between Excel and JavaScript—circular dependencies, modularizing programs, readability, etc.

## On natural language-based human computer communication (10, 15)

{/* TODO: */}

> We begin, in chapter 2, by asking why we need end user programming systems at all. Aren’t natural language-based systems that will allow us to just tell the computer what we want right around the corner? We discussed the computer's conversational abilities and argue that conversation is not the best model for human computer communication.

It's hard not to read this chapter as the AI chapter and Nardi as an AI skeptic.

> The computer fails to understand and to speak because much of what is understood in a conversation attaches to the context in which the participants of a conversation find themselves, and of which they have knowledge.

- Computers don’t have senses…but now in 2024 let’s say they can hear and see. How important are smell and touch?

## On alternatives to natural language (16, 24)

Nardi

> To play a piece of music...we read the score. An important communicative event has occurred over what may have been a great deal of time and space.

{/* TODO: */}

> We want to argue here that just as formal languages have served computer scientists well, they will serve end users well...Unlike conversational communication, formal languages can be text-based or graphical.

This reminds me of something I read recently in [_Make It Stick_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick)—that there is no empirical support for the common claim that instruction in one’s preferred
learning style improves learning outcomes. For example, we often hear people (myself included) say "I am a visual learner," but as yet there's no evidence to back it up. From the book:

> The popular notion that you learn better when you receive instruction in a form consistent with your preferred learning style, for example as an auditory or visual learner, is not supported by the empirical research. People do have multiple forms of intelligence to bring to bear on learning, and you learn better when you “go wide,” drawing on all of your aptitudes and resourcefulness, than when you limit instruction or experience to the style you find most amenable.
> ...
> It is more important that the mode of instruction match the nature of the subject being taught: visual instruction for geometry and geography, verbal instruction for poetry, and so on. When instructional style matches the nature of the content, all learners learn better, regardless of their differing preferences for how the material is taught.

I like Nardi's point. Natural language is the hammer making all computer tasks look like nails. The 2023 version would be chatbots as the hammer.
