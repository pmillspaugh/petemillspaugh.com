I have been reading more lately, and reading begets reading.

Reading begets reading like [running begets running](/reading-like-running) and cleanliness begets cleanliness (something my cousin Liz said to me once about living in college apartments with friends—the opposite is also true, that dirtiness begets dirtiness). I guess doing something begets doing more of that something.

Dating back to last month I’ve read [Born to Run](/born-to-run), [How Not to Die](/how-not-to-die), [Eat & Run](/eat-and-run), and [North](/north). I’ve started to read chapters of books off the shelf at the [Merc](https://mercantilelibrary.com) while I eat lunch, like [Kitchen Confidential](/kitchen-confidential).

It’s an energizing habit because I’m less overwhelemed and more excited by the pile of books I’ve checked out from the public library at any given time. There’s just so much good stuff to read.
