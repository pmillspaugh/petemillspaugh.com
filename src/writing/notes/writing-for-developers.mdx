I’m reading [_Writing for Developers_](https://github.com/scynthiadunlop/WritingForDevelopersBook/) by Cynthia Dunlop and Piotr Sarna with the [Overcommitted podcast book club](https://github.com/overcommitted-dev/tech-book-club/). We’re two weeks in, and so far we’ve read chapters 1, 2, 3, and 8.

## On patterns

In the same way that this book identifies patterns of blog posts (“Bug Hunt”, “Rewrote It in X”), it might be helpful to collect a list of [snowclones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone) to be used as titles. Like, I’m using _The secret life of X_ for my book’s subtitle. But there are countless others. _Uber for X_; _Grokking Y_; _Z Considered Harmful_.

## On minimalism

> Clean, clear, and straight to the point. This blog post’s appearance and writing style are exactly what you would expect from someone who implemented a functional search engine in 80 lines of code. (41)

Chapter 3 on “Captivating readers” includes case studies of top Hacker News posts from last year. This quote is from Cynthia and Piotr’s discussion of [A search engine in 80 lines of Python](https://www.alexmolas.com/2024/02/05/a-search-engine-in-80-lines.html) by Alex Molas.

I’m torn between minimalist blogs with high information density and beautifully designed blogs where you have to scroll below the fold to get to the meat of a post (on mobile, at least). Two of my blogging models are [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com) and [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com). Tom’s blog is pretty minimalist, and Maggie’s blog is big and beautiful. I like both at different times for different reasons. My garden is modeled more after Maggie’s style. You can always zoom in on small text, but it usually doesn’t work as well to zoom out on big text. The best of both worlds may be offering a minimalist reading mode, e.g. [by appending `.txt` to any post URL](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/).

## On bragging

> Tech world bragging at the right dosage is good for you and your peers. (157)

A blog can be a public [brag doc](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). I have trouble motivating to write a brag doc, but I like the idea of a blog as a way to track work you’re most proud of. Not everything in a private brag doc would work in a public one, of course, but it can cover some of the same ground and make the chore more gratifying.

## Everything but the words

<Callout>
  Now that I’m writing and publishing my own book, I like to take note of a
  book’s construction. All the choices made outside of the writing
  itself—everything but the words. Reading Debbie Berne’s The Design of Books is
  helping me develop a discerning eye for such details.

So many people work together on a traditionally published book! Beyond this book’s two authors, the copyright page lists eight team members—five editors and three others: developmental editor, technical editor, review editor, production editor, copy editor, proofreader, typesetter, and cover designer. I don’t actually know what each editor does. What’s the difference between a copy editor and a proofreader? Plus dozens and dozens of people read drafts of the book.

## Why

I have three _whys_ for reading this book:

1. Become a better [programmer-writer](/programmer-writer) for my [book](https://dotcom.press), my [job](https://val.town), and my [garden](/about#garden)
2. Join a community of programmer-writers
3. Learn how to run a writers’ book club (I’m leading a local one this spring)
