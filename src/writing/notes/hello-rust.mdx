I just wrote my first Rust program. Er, it’s not really even _my_ program—I just read an example from a book, tried to implement it from memory a few minutes later, ran `cargo run`, then used hints from the Rust compiler to fix my code. First impression…the hints are really good!

Here’s the function:

```rust
fn gcd(mut n: u64, mut m: u64) -> u64 {
  assert!(n != 0 && m != 0);
  while m != 0 {
    if m < n {
      let t = m;
      m = n;
      n = t;
    }
    m = m % n;
  }
  n
}
```

I’m starting with O’Reilly’s [_Programming Rust_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/), but I plan to go through [_The Book_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) in parallel and see what sticks.

I also <del>wrote</del> _copied_ my first test in Rust, which quickly caught a bug in my greatest common divisor implementation.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_gcd() {
  assert_eq!(gcd(14, 15), 1);

  assert_eq!(gcd(2 * 3 * 5 * 11 * 13, 3 * 7 * 11 * 19), 3 * 11);
}
```

It's pretty nice that `cargo` includes tests out of the box without having to install a dependency.
