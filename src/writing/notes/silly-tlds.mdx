I’ve known there are a bunch of novel TLDs ([top-level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain)) since the first time I bought a domain, but I didn’t quite appreciate the extent of it until seeing [porkbun.com/awesome](https://porkbun.com/awesome).

<Figure.Porkbun />

Lots of them are very specific—like `.coffee` or `.cafe` for a coffee shop—which I find very satisfying. But then some are downright goofy. I mean, `.bob_ross`?? There are 424 options on porkbun, by my count. I only screenshotted a small subset.

## TLD history

The history of TLDs is interesting. For example, I heard on a [syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) podcast (I can’t remember which episode, but that’s a great use of `.fm`) that Anguilla now has a pretty significant revenue stream from their `.ai` ending.

## TLDs I’ve used

The most fun TLDs I’ve actually used are [weeksofyour.life](https://weeksofyour.life) and [pete.football](https://www.pete.football). I did own a `.band` domain at one point when my friend asked me to make a website for his band, but sadly he moved to LA and the band split up. Looking at these gets my wheels turning, though. I already have somewhat of a compulsive domain buying habit, so this makes things much harder. Like, I could move this very website to `pete.garden`, or someone could build an interactive version of <em>Where’s Waldo</em> at `wheres.waldo`.

## TLDs in the wild

I love coming across uncommon TLDs, like [val.town](https://val.town), [standup.nyc](https://standup.nyc), [neal.fun](https://neal.fun), [same.energy](https://same.energy), [emoji.supply/kitchen](https://emoji.supply/kitchen), [devtools.fm](https://devtools.fm) and [radio.garden](https://radio.garden). Another cool use case is endings that complete a name, like [ciechanow.ski](https://ciechanow.ski/). Those websites are all very cool beyond clever TLDs, btw, so do some exploring if you’re interested!
