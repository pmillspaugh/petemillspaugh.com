A year ago I visited [my 37th state](/37-states), New Mexico. Then in April, [38](/38-states): Texas. Today I stopped in Indiana—number 39—on the way from Chicago to Cincinnati.

Some people I talk to only “count” a state if they’ve spent the night. My (revised) criteria is that I’ve stopped for a meal or to check out a landmark—something that gives me some sense of the place. Airports don’t count.

I stopped for an hour or two in Indianapolis, where the grass was very green and the sky was very blue. I got a cold brew at [Quill’s Coffee](https://quillscoffee.com/) and explored the [Indianapolis Public Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iUBkcex2SQK3ndbx8), all six floors. The librarians were that rare breed of midwesterner-plus-librarian nice, and there was this neat arch made of books, big enough to walk under.
