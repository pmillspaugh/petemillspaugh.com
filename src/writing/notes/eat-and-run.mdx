[Eat & Run](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13202092-eat-run) and [North](/north) are both entertaining books for the runner or running-interested.

I didn’t necessarily _like_ Jurek or think I’d want to be friends with him after reading _Eat & Run_. The whole thing is very self-indulgent, and yet I really enjoyed reading it because the subject matter is quite interesting. I have come to like him after reading more and seeing him in some YouTube videos/documentaries. I think he’s a gracious competitor, and I admire his drive.

I do like how he interleaved the vegan recipes in each chapter. I likely wouldn’t sit down a read a book that was only recipes, and I probably would have skipped most of the recipes if they were 50 consolidated pages at the end of the book. Sprinkling them in was a pleasant change of pace, which also served to aid my memory of ingredients via spaced repetition.
