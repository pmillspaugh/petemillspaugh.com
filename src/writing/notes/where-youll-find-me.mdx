I read [Where You’ll Find Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36019816-where-you-ll-find-me) by Ty Gagne. I also listened to [The Last Traverse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55946570-the-last-traverse) as an audiobook. I recommend both, especially if you’re into winter adventure of any sort or familiar with the White Mountains.

Ty Gagne’s books remind me that experience can skew your perception of risk. That is, experience can hurt you. You get inoculated to risks involved in things you do regularly. For me, cycling is an example. I aim to be careful (reflective gear, lights, bike lanes and trails), but I do find myself on busy roads sometimes. I seldom feel nervous biking on busy roads because I’m used to it, but it presents a real danger.

For other people, texting and driving is an example of this. Texting and driving is incredibly dangerous, but people get used to it. It’s one of the reasons cycling on busy roads is dangerous.
