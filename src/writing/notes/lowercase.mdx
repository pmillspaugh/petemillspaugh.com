i might switch to lowercase.

no capital letters in texts, tweets, slack, notes, git commits, etc.

I don’t think I have the guts, though. I definitely couldn’t send a lowercase email. And I won’t ditch capitalization in this garden. Capitalization let’s you do cool things like call someone capital G “Good” or emphasize your own Important Thing.

But lowercase is definitely cool, too. [Tom](https://twitter.com/tmcw) and [Alana](https://twitter.com/alanaagoyal) and (another friend) Tom do it, and I really like what they have to say. It’s more approachable and casual, and I like things that are approachable and casual. It’s endearing.

I tend to overthink things, which is why I don’t yet have a tattoo and probably never will. maybe i can start with lowercase.
