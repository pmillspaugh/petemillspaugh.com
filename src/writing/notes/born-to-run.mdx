I read [_Born to Run_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run) by Christopher McDougall earlier this year and loved it. It was my first step on a trail of running books including _Eat & Run_, _North_, _Where You’ll Find Me_, _Marathon_, and _Rise of the Ultrarunners_.

I wish I’d written more about it when it was fresh. Maybe I’ll write about it later, but for now I heartily recommend reading it.
