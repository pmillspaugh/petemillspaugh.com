We are starting a Future of Coding (FoC) book club! Anyone interested is quite welcome (tl;dr - join the [FoC Slack community](https://futureofcoding.org/community) and find the `#reading-together` channel).

[Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org/) is a wonderful community of programmers, designers, researchers, etc.—really anyone interested in the history and future of computing. There’s a Slack channel, newsletter, and podcast, and there are meetups from time to time in London, SF, NYC, and other cities.

Slack is where we nominate and vote on books, schedule club meetings, and what not. As of today (Feb 11 ’24), we are still nominating and voting on our first book. The first meeting will likely be sometime in March or April.

## Book recs

Recently I’ve been reading up on the history of programming and the Web in books like _The Dream Machine_, <Link href="/hackers-and-painters">_Hackers & Painters_</Link>, _Working in Public_, and <Link href="the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering">_The Art of Doing Science and Engineering_</Link>.

I wanted to start an FoC book club as a forum to discuss these books and also a way to find other great books in the genre (and make friends!). On that note, if you have book ideas please do [lmk](mailto:pete@petemillspaugh.com), or suggest a book directly on Slack.

Here’s my (growing) list:

- _A Small Matter of Programming_ — Bonnie Nardi
- _Mindstorms_ — Seymour Papert
- _Weaving the Web_ — Tim Berners-Lee
- _The Soul of a New Machine_ — Tracy Kidder
- _The Children’s Machine_ — Seymour Papert
