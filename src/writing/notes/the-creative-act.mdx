I read [The Creative Act](https://bookshop.org/a/115276/9780593652886) by Rick Rubin. The first few Areas of Thought (chapters) are so similar to [The Artist’s Way](/the-artists-way) by Julia Cameron that I would be shocked if Cameron wasn’t a major influence. Or maybe there are certain artistic, creative Truths that one arrives at independently.

The book is cut up into 78 vignettes on creativity that flow sequentially but can also stand alone. In that way it reminds me a lot of [Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff](/dont-sweat-the-small-stuff). You might read it by picking out a chapter at a time that calls you. Or you can read it cover to cover then return to ones that resonate. Ideas contradict, but that’s reflective of life ("opposites attract" versus "birds of a feather flock together"). He also notes up front that you should read with light attachment, holding onto what you like and letting go of what you don’t.

I didn’t know who [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin) was until looking him up halfway through the book. I expected more of an erudite tortoise shell framed novelist than bearded hip hop producer, which was actually a welcome surprise. A friend told me that Rubin is known for entering a studio session, pacing around the room, stroking his beard, pausing, then making a single divine adjustment to the track in one motion—a swipe of the finger or turn of a knob—to produce a hit record.
