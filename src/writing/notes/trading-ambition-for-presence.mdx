When I am going through a rough patch, I like to _trade ambition for presence_. When things are going well, it’s energizing to think about the future, to plan, to dream, to have ambition. But when things are hard, I find it helpful to center on the present and filter out the past and future, if only temporarily.

Julia Cameron in [The Artist’s Way](/the-artists-way) talks about paying attention to _now_ when there’s pain in the past and future. Presence includes both place and time. Place is _here_. Time is _now_. Paying attention to _here_ and _now_ means you are not fixated on past or future.

Movement toward the present is movement toward friends, toward offline, toward civic engagement, toward the earth, toward artist-brain. A similar expression I like is to “be where your feet are.” I picked this up as a sort of mantra among Baltimore Ravens players during press conferences and locker room interviews over the past couple seasons.
