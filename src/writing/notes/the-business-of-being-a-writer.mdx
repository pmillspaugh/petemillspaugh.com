I read [_The Business of Being a Writer_](https://businessofwriting.org/) by Jane Friedman. I found out about this book through an event at the [Mercantile Library](https://www.mercantilelibrary.com), my favorite local place to write. I attended Jane’s talk on a whim, but it ended up having a material influence on my career as I wrote about in my [July clipping](/july-2025).

This book pairs really well with [_The Artist’s Way_](/the-artists-way). Both reject the myth of the starving artist. _The Artist’s Way_ gives conviction and confidence in your creative potential. _The Business of Being a Writer_ teaches you that your creative goals don’t have to conflict with the practical concern of earning a living.

I really like Jane’s angle that business concerns for the artist are actually creative, too. It helps turn a negative into a positive. Rather than selling out, you are exercising creativity to discover what mix of work both sustains and nourishes you. This really resonates. I love writing plain English, but I also love writing code (i.e. making websites). It doesn’t have to be _either_ get a full-time software engineering job _or_ go full writer. You can find a proper balance with a mix of work. It could be writing, freelance web development, and teaching, for example.

_Nearly a year after I wrote the above, I am doing just that: working as a [programmer-writer](/programmer-writer) three days per week at [val.town](https://val.town) while working on my book, [the secret life of domains](https://dotcom.press), the other days. It’s a new good-problem-to-have challenge balancing two things, each of which I wish I could dedicate all of my time to._
