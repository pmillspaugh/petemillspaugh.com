My favorite label right now for [what I do](/what-do-you-do)<Sup>1</Sup> is _programmer-writer_.

I first saw it in Jason Kehe’s WIRED profile of Robin Sloan. The article is titled “The Tech World’s Greatest Living Novelist Goes Meta,” and it’s not just a profile—it’s a profile _about profiling_ Sloan, mostly full of Kehe’s inner monologue:

> _Just give him some impressive-sounding title that can’t be ignored. “The quintessential Bay Area author,” say—but less local. Or “the programmer-writer’s programmer-writer”—but less esoteric. Oh, that’s it: He’s “the tech world’s greatest living novelist.”_

I think he should have called it “The programmer-writer’s programmer-writer.” Anyhoo, after I saw that I came to like the label. It’s helpful to have a name or mental model for an archetype or phenomenon you’ve observed.

What is a programmer-writer? Someone who writes and programs and writes about programming<Sup>2</Sup>. Who is a programmer-writer? [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com) and [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com) are two of my favorites, but there are so many more great ones, of course.

Programmer-writer as a label is kind of like [design engineer](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/the-case-for-design-engineers/). Maggie is both (!), so I guess that makes her a designer-programmer-writer or something, which doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. Maybe I’ll make a list of programmer-writers like her [collection of design engineers](https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers).

## Footnotes

(1) What do I do now? I’m writing a [book about domains](https://dotcom.press). I also code: on the book’s website, its [email newsletter system](https://val.town/x/petermillspaugh/dotcom), and [research](https://val.town/x/petermillspaugh/tld-wiki) [experiments](https://dotcom.press/archive/wordle).

(2) Do I just mean programmers who blog? Maybe! But again, I find labels helpful sometimes. Like, recently I read Steve Krouse’s [find a model](https://stevekrouse.com/model) blog post (Steve is another great p.-w.), and even though I already used that technique sometimes, I started thinking to use it more once it became a _thing_ with a name in my head.
