This morning I read [panphora’s post](https://bsky.app/profile/hyperspace.so/post/3ld6qd3zehd25) on Bluesky about switching to a dot com domain. He cited Paul Graham’s advice to [Change Your Name](https://paulgraham.com/name.html) if you don’t have `.com`.

That was written almost a decade ago. So, do you still need a dot com domain?

## They’re all taken

To state the obvious, dot com domains work well because customers know where to find you, and it signals legitimacy. The main problem is availability. As an experiment, I typed four adjacent words into Cloudflare’s domain registrar:

- `bean.com`
- `beans.com`
- `beanie.com`
- `beanies.com`

To no surprise, none are available. But they’re not _really_ all taken. [beans.com](https://beans.com) serves a very simple static website. [beanie.com](https://beanie.com) is available for $200k, and both [bean.com](https://bean.com) and [beanies.com](https://beanies.com) redirect. So it’s possible that all four of those are available, for a price.

In my experience, the vast majority of dot com domains for valid English words less than about 8 characters are already spoken for. That’s a very unscientific hunch, but more often than not I have to think outside of the box when buying a domain.

## Alternatives

TLDs like `.co`, `.info`, `.io`, and `.xyz` have become common, but `.com`, `.org`, and `.net` still seem to dominate.

Every company in the top 20 of the Fortune 500 uses dot com (not counting [abc.xyz](https://abc.xyz/) because _google.com_ is their real homepage, ofc). Of the 32 Top YC companies listed on [ycombinator.com](https://ycombinator.com) these days, only one doesn’t use a dot com (based in India, uses `.in`).

Lately there are tons of startups using `.ai`. Anguilla earned [$32M in 2023](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/05/15/cf-an-ai-powered-boost-to-anguillas-revenues) from `.ai` registrations, which is over 20% of their government’s total revenue (!). I’d think twice before buying a ccTLD now, though, after reading that `.io` is <Link href="/serious-tlds">in jeopardy</Link>.

## dot com, eventually

My gut tells me we’re at a tipping point where few dot com domains are available and the general public is ok with other TLDs. But maybe all startups wish they had `.com` eventually.

OpenAI recently bought _chat.com_ for over $15M. And on a smaller, more relatable scale, Justin Duke wrote about [paying $85k](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/buttondown-dot-com/) to buy [buttondown.com](https://buttondown.com) (prev _buttondown.email_).

I do think novel TLDs are less controversial for lower stakes side projects like [weeksofyour.life](https://weeksofyour.life). And that’s good because I am a <Link href="/silly-tlds">sucker</Link> for fun TLDs. Sometimes projects turn into day jobs, though, so the lines are blurry.
