I re-read [_A Gentleman in Moscow_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34066798-a-gentleman-in-moscow) with the Zillenial book club at the Mercantile Library here in Cincinnati. After discussing the book, the group went to the Metropole (with an “e”) hotel bar a couple streets north, well chosen what with the entire book set in the Metropol (no “e”) hotel in Moscow. I couldn’t make it to the Metropole, sadly, but I walked by a week later and started thinking about the book again, which lead me here to record some notes.

The writing is pretty indulgent, but he pulls it off, and I didn’t mind indulging. It’s something of a hack to make your protagonist a pretentious aristocrat so that you the author have full license to be as witty and wordy as you want. It’s been a while since I read _Rules of Civility_ and _The Lincoln Highway_, and I can’t remember how many SAT words were in those. There were several comments on the book/author/protagonist’s pretentiousness in our book club. Many people were put off by his showmanship with obscure words and too-clever turns of phrase. Fair enough. There were many words I couldn’t define or flat out knew not, but I resisted the urge to pull out the dictionary and instead took my contextual guesses and kept reading. And btw, during the discussion I kept wondering whether the noun form of _pretentious_ is _pretentiousness_ or _pretention_. It turns out _pretension_ is a word but is not a synonym for _pretentiousness_, unlike _aggression_ and _aggressiveness_.

{/* The first Montaigne essay about diverse means to the same end reminds me of The Myth of Sisyphus. Montaigne describes two means to neutralize your captor, your enemy in power: the first is submission, which supposedly leads to pity (but what if it doesn’t?); the second he calls “audacity and steadfastness.” Camus calls that second one scorn. Count Rostov calls it being “proud and unbent.” A third means not mentioned is fighting back, which risks violence and escalation. So three means: submission, steadfastness, and rebellion. Right now Gavin Newsom is fighting, and I guess you could say Mamdani is holding steady. Who’s submitting? Tim Cook? Gretchen Whitmer? Muriel Bowser? Big Tech is definitely bending the knee / kissing the ring. What are the scientists and academics doing? Other politicians? Judges? Universities? Corporate law? Doctors? */}

{/* “As we age, we are bound to find comfort from the notion that it takes generations for a way of life to fade. We are familiar with the songs our grandparents favored, after all, even though we never danced to them ourselves. At festive holidays, the recipes we pull from the drawer are routinely many decades old, and in some cases even written in the hand of a relative long since dead. And the objects in our home? The oriental coffee tables and well-worn desks that have been handed down from generation to generation? Despite being “out of fashion,” not only do they add beauty to our daily lives, they lend material credibility to our presumption that the passing of an era will be glacial. But under certain circumstances, the Count finally acknowledged, this process can occur in the comparative blink of an eye. Popular upheaval, political turmoil, industrial progress—any combination of these could cause the evolution of a society to leapfrog generations, sweeping aside aspects of the past that might otherwise have lingered for decades. And this must be especially so, when those with newfound power are men who distrust any form of hesitation or nuance, and who prize self-assurance above all.” (144). This reads very current w/r/t AI and Trump 2.0—especially that last sentence. We are living in a time of political and industrial upheaval in America, in a bad way (on the balance, so far, IMO). */}

{/* In the “1952: America” chapter, the Count weighs two futures of Russia: technology-forward and globalized (like America), or traditional and isolationist. “I think if I were a garage door, I should rather miss the old days.” (352) I'm realizing now that I misinterpreted this sentence. I initially took it to mean that the garage door would miss [the nature of the job](/the-nature-of-the-job), like a programmer compelled to use AI might miss coding by hand and brain. But now I see that the personified garage door was passive before and active now. It's the human operating the garage door who should rather miss the old days. */}
