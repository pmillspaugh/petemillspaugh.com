Devoting the time to self-study Computer Science is a classic debate for the self-taught/bootcamp grad programmer like me. I've kicked around versions of this question before, but what really got me thinking critically about it recently is Oz Nova's [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

I am familiar with Oz from his podcast [CS Primer](https://show.csprimer.com/) with Charlie Harrington (I really like their show—they record highly casual, meandering conversations related to programming education).

{/* TODO: all the below thought stream needs some major cleanup and reordering */}

Pure, academic learning (as opposed to practical, applied learning) is engaging but can feel like a waste of precious time. It’s a balance of course, and it takes decades to build expertise outside of your day-to-day—not months or even years. There are supposedly amazing books out there that can be quite intimidating

Designing Data-Intensive Applications has a 4.71 on Goodreads! That’s an outstanding rating. I read a handful of chapters there and did find it interesting, although it would have been more helpful as someone gearing up to be a CTO than an IC working on fullstack web applications. It’s important how you learn, too. Reading that and taking notes now feels pointless because I didn’t quickly apply most of it. So most of it is lost or being slowly pruned from my brain. But! If I apply Anki to pure learning it becomes durable.

It’s about learning for the unknown unknowns. I’m not sure when I’ll use this knowledge if at all, but just in case. My overarching learning strategy is to build STEM fundamentals because I don’t know when they’ll come in handy. It’s not just for work. Learning about human biology is useful as a runner (or just as a human who sleeps). Learning about food chemistry is useful as a casual chef. I allocate most time to short- and medium-term things and then a good chunk of time to this pure learning. Even if certain knowledge doesn’t come in handy at work or in personal pursuits, the act of learning itself is pleasurable.

There are countless other highly regarded, thick books. Like [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell](). It’s a thousand pages! I heard James Brady (who leads engineering at Elicit) recommend that on a podcast.

Back to Oz. His suggested curriculum is no joke. 100-200 hours for each of 9 topics. Even if you did 100 hours each at a fairly aggressive 4 hours per week, that would take almost 5 years! Depending on your job, it’s likely you have much more than 4 hours per week free, but so much competes for those hours! Side projects, other pure learning, writing, reading, cooking, running/biking/climbing/basketball, time with friends, etc. Tim Urban has an essay that visualizes the time we have and how we spend it, which will get you thinking (got me thinking, at least). Oz says that if the suggested curriculum is too much then start with just two books: Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective and Designing Data-Intensive Applications. Those are 562 pages and 978 pages, respectively. I like to read, but I’m definitely not a prolific reader. I’ve read a few thousand(ish) page books (David Copperfield, Infinite Jest), but I’ve also failed to read others (Alexander Hamilton, Infinite Jest on my first attempt). And it takes a while! Who is a prolific reader? E.g. I heard Retool CEO David Hsu say on a podcast the other day (Latent Space) that he reads a book a week. He didn’t say audiobook, but maybe that’s it? Maybe audiobooks on 2x is how some of my friends mark multiple books a month as read on Goodreads. But, I don’t think I’m learning as much with an audiobook or podcast. I do listen to lots of podcasts, and often I pause to take notes and look stuff up. Plus, a really thick book (thick as in dense material, not necessarily length) takes way longer to read for good comprehension. It can be somewhat like how I remember reading Don Quixote in Spanish was—looking up every fourth word in a dictionary. And that kind of takes the fun out of it, or at least makes it super effortful and exhausting and easy to quit. So you’d have to be really dedicated to read those massive Computer Science books.

I like Michael Nielsen’s approach described in his essay Augmenting Long-Term Memory. He advises reading thick papers outside of your domain expertise in phases and layers. E.g. you do a quick first read, looking things up now and again but mostly skipping sections that are way beyond your depth. He makes Anki cards for the new concepts he can understand relatively quickly. Then after building a foundation of knowledge from that paper and related study, he does a second pass at the paper. And then even a third pass, etc. I like this a lot. It’s all about deciding where to draw the line in the sand for abstractions in your mental models. I find that writing Anki cards really helps with this. I find myself saying in my head, “ok I get the basics, but I don’t know how that would be implemented, and I can’t reconcile this other thing, but that would be too big a rabbit hole for now.”

Without a full time job, the calculus changes quite a bit, obviously. Like, taking N months between jobs and dedicating a large portion of that time to CS sounds more palatable. But I think if I did that I’d way rather spend the lion’s share of my time building an ambitious software project. The kind of side project you dream about but there simply aren’t enough weekends for. Or join a program like Recurse, where I suppose you could do both.

Can I trojan horse my way into learning CS? E.g. by learning Rust for some job or side project I will learn more about algorithms, operating systems, computer memory, etc. (3/7/24) Paul Butler on devtools.fm literally just said that (around 28:00) - Rust teaches you computer science as you learn it. “It kind of teaches you computer science almost as you do it. Like, even though there’s a learning curve with it I always feel like I’ve learned something not just about Rust but about computation when I get past one of those hurdles. So I like that about Rust.”
