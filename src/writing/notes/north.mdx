As with [Eat & Run](/eat-and-run), I don’t come away particularly liking Scott Jurek or thinking he’s a great writer after reading [North](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34219858-north). But the subject matter is interesting to me, so I’m glad I read it and would recommend it to others who’ve hiked chunks of the AT or are otherwise interested in distance running and remarkable feats of endurance.

I think it’s irresponsible the way he casually recounts sleep deprivation. He glamorizes the pain and harm done to his body in a way that I think might make others inclined to deprive themselves of sleep and push themselves too far. I get that it’s his nature to push himself, and I sympathize with that being his way of facing and moving through life’s challenges. But the end result, for me, is a runner with a really big ego who wouldn’t want to admit that part of what he did is irresponsible, or at least comes with serious risks and tradeoffs.

I think the way he mentions deaths along the AT is also done in a glamorizing way. More “people have died here so it’s really impressive what I’m doing” and less “there are serious risks hiking/running along the AT, so if you do it please read up and prepare diligently”. See [The Last Traverse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55946570-the-last-traverse) and [Where You’ll Find Me](/where-youll-find-me) as terrific counterexamples.

But yeah, at the end of reading it I do want to go run-hike the Pemigewasset loop or Presidential traverse in one day, and I do want to go explore the Smokey Mountains. It blew my mind that 7 of the 10 tallest peaks on the AT are south of Virginia!
