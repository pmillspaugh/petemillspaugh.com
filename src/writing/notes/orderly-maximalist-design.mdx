I love what I think of as “orderly maximalist” design. Lots of stuff everywhere, a rainbow of colors and textures, but neat. I’d like to see orderly maximalist websites. Ones with lots of content, color, and decoration. Less open space and minimalist icons (which I do enjoy when done right, too!). Websites created using [mmm.page](https://mmm.page/) tend to be maximalist, but not always orderly (there are exceptions, I’m sure).

I’m in the beautiful [Mercantile Library](https://www.mercantilelibrary.com/) right now, which made me think of it. Libraries are very much orderly maximalist. Books everywhere, neatly lined and stacked. The Merc has maximalist flair, too, like the lady made of books.

My last apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn was pretty orderly maximalist. I mostly thank my roommate who is a chef for that design influence. Kitchens and restaurants are another example of orderly maximalism. Climbing gyms are also orderly maximalist, or “colorful maximalist” as I originally termed it. My partner and I decorated our current house in this o.m. aesthetic.

Why do physical spaces have so much stuff? There are overhead lights and sconces and lamps and candles for lighting, curtains for darkening and privacy, chairs and couches to sit on, pillows for comfort and decoration, books on shelves and tables, coasters for drinks, rugs and wallpaper and framed art, pots of plants and vases of flowers.
