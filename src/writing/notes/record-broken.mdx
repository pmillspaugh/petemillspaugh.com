I noticed a phenomenon—well, idk if I can call it that yet until I think of more examples—kinda like [Square Theory](https://aaronson.org/blog/square-theory). Not similar structurally to ST, just similar in that it’s another observation about the relationship between words or expressions.

I was writing the expression “I sound like a broken record” as in something that I’ve repeated over and over, but for a pleasing derivative I rewrote it as “that record is broken.” But then I realized: I associate the derivative more closely with breaking a record (as in Fastest Known Time on the Appalachian Trail) than broken record (as in a vinyl that loops).

So to clean this example up, we have two turns of phrase:

1. Broken record
2. Record broken

Flipping the order of words alters the meaning of the phrase. In the first, record is most likely to be interpreted as a vinyl record. In the second, record probably means a top achievement.

Or, alternatively:

1. Broken record
2. Breaking record(s)

Changing the verb from broken to breaking alters the meaning of the phrase. Is there something here? Maybe not, but for now I’m on the lookout for other examples.
