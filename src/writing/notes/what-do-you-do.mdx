Chris Coyier wrote about [what he does](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/01/19/what-do-you-do/). I’ve never quite been satisfied with my answer to “what do you do?” when people casually ask. It’s one of those small things that I get asked all the time but never really care enough to work on. But maybe I should, because if you say the right thing it can lead to interesting conversations (or better yet, asking the right questions to the person you’re talking to about what _they_ do).

When I was an investment banker I especially wasn’t a fan of answering that question, probably because I wasn’t super proud of the job or I didn’t think it fit my identity or it didn’t lead to interesting conversations. Back then I started to think I should specifically find a job that is immediately explainable, like my brother’s: “I’m a middle school English teacher.”

Nowadays I usually say, “I’m a software engineer,” or “I make websites,” or some variation including “programmer,” “coder,” “web developer,” etc. Ironically, [what I want to work on next](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/my-next-next-next-job)—devtools—can be hard to explain and dry to most people. But I’ve come around to feeling totally ok doing something that I can’t explain on a 6-word bumper sticker.

What do you do?
