I think about present me in relation to past and future me often. Generalized, I think of this concept as _present you._

Present you has a set of interests and desires. Because you want those things at this moment, you also want future you to want those things. You might even wish past you had also wanted those things so you’d be farther along by now. Past you is somewhat powerless because what’s done is done. Present you can steer and influence future you—or really future _yous_—though. Present you feels like it should have full control over future you, but to really believe that would be naive. Future you will have an altered set of interests and desires. So present you wants dominion over past and future you but knows it doesn’t have it.
