  This is the first piece of writing I’ve planted in my garden that’s not
  remotely related to programming. I might do some re-potting at some point to
  separate the nerdy stuff from the random stuff.

I’m in Albuquerque, New Mexico at what’s clearly a cornerstone community restaurant called [Frontier](https://www.frontierrestaurant.com/) that spans a full block, almost. I had two tacos the size of small burritos, and while walking here I stopped at a Buffalo Exchange looking for sunglasses but instead bought a Colorado Rockies tshirt. I’m not a Rockies fan, but I have a friend who is, and I like purple, so I’ll wear it until I see him next (not continuously) then hand it down to him. I ate both tacos and used a lot of napkins. I’m wearing the Rockies tshirt.

I’m here in New Mexico for my cousin’s wedding in Santa Fe (I’m especially excited about the “Festive Casual” dress code). As of this morning, I’ve been to 37 states.

Airport layovers don’t count. My criteria is that I’ve actually _stepped foot_ in the state, so that 37 includes states that I’ve passed through on roadtrips and at least got out of the car (e.g. barbecue lunch in St. Louis, Missouri in May 2018). Here are the 37 I’ve been to:

1. Maryland
1. Virginia
1. New Hampshire
1. New York
1. New Jersey
1. Massachusetts
1. Rhode Island
1. Connecticut
1. Pennsylvania
1. Delaware
1. West Virginia
1. North Carolina
1. South Carolina
1. Vermont
1. Wyoming
1. Idaho
1. Montana
1. Illinois
1. Louisiana
1. Maine
1. Georgia
1. Florida
1. California
1. Arizona
1. Michigan
1. Hawaii
1. Tennessee
1. Missouri
1. Kansas
1. Colorado
1. Utah
1. Oregon
1. Nevada
1. Iowa
1. Ohio
1. Kentucky
1. New Mexico

And here are the baker’s dozen I haven’t been to (in alphabetical order):

1. Alabama
1. Alaska
1. Arkansas
1. Indiana
1. Minnesota
1. Mississippi
1. Nebraska
1. North Dakota
1. Oklahoma
1. South Dakota
1. Texas
1. Washington
1. Wisconsin

I moved to Ohio this year, and I can see Kentucky from my house. OH and KY were my last two before NM, and Indiana (IN) is like a 10 minute drive, so that’ll probably be #38.
