Instead of writing down books I want to read on a list, I’ve started directly placing holds at my local public library.

I think it’s a better system. Here’s how it works:

1. When you’re seriously interested in a book, place a hold at your library.
1. Pick up books whenever you’re near the library.
1. Leave books around your apartment/house. Bedside table, coffee table, kitchen table.
1. Read a chapter here, a chapter there. One before bed. Another when the pasta is cooking. Another at commercial breaks during The Big Game. Another on the toilet.
1. If a book doesn’t hook you, return it next time you’re near the library. Also pick up your new holds. Repeat.

If you live in the US, you probably have a public library near you. I live in Cincinnati, and the Cincinnati Public Library almost always has the book I want. There are a couple branches I can walk to in under 30 minutes. Before Cincy I lived in Brooklyn. No matter where you live in Brooklyn there’s probably a branch you can walk to (61 total).

## Read books like you watch TV shows

A book should be like a TV show. You watch just one episode to start or maybe the whole season over a few weeks. Or you jump to another show and go back and forth. Or abandon the first one entirely. Then maybe you pick it back up three years later.

Book-reader fit is important. I don’t think you should force a book if you aren’t interested or in the mood (generally speaking). You can come back to it later. Just because [present you](/present-you) doesn’t like it doesn’t mean future you won’t.

## Buying books

Buying books you haven’t read yet puts pressure on you to stubbornly persist through bad books or bad book-reader fit. In the end it means you read fewer books.

If you like the book, you can always buy it after you read it. Or while you’re reading it if you already love it and want to dog-ear pages and write in the margins like I do. Or buy it before reading if you want to support the author and/or your local independent bookstore (via [bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org) if you want the online convenience).
