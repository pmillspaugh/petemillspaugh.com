In October I wrote about [my 37th state](/37-states), New Mexico. I’m continuing the tradition here with #38, Texas. I visited Dallas for a weekend, half of which was not like I pictured (green, posh, felt like LA) and half of which was just like I pictured (pulled pork sandwich, rodeo in Fort Worth).

Indiana is about a half hour from my house, so I really ought to go there for #39. I did drive through Indiana on the way to Chicago, but after some deliberation I decided not to count that. Our stop for gas didn't cut it—a full sit down meal is where I draw the line. Airport layovers don’t count.
