I’m reading Richard Hamming’s [_The Art of Doing Science and Engineering_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering). Page numbers refer to the [Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com/the-art-of-doing-science-and-engineering) copy (which, btw—if you’ve never stumbled upon Stripe Press, it’s worth spending a few minutes there. It’s one of the most beautiful sites on the Web).

## On napkin math (5-7)

Hamming notes that back-of-the-envelope calculations are widely used by great scientists and seldom used by run-of-the-mill scientists. He does some quick math to check the compatibility of two claims he makes: that knowledge doubles roughly every 17 years, and that 90% of all scientists who have ever lived are alive today.

On _why_ you should do napkin math, he argues that it gives you a good feeling for the truth or falsity of whatever was claimed, and that it gets you thinking about factors that didn’t immediately come to mind. This second one resonates. I find that things often seem coherent in my brain until I force myself to explain or write them down.

## On science versus engineering (9)

> “In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.”
>
> “In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.”

I like the cleverness of this wordplay. Science is discovery, and engineering is application. But I think it applies mostly to classical engineering—like, you should know how to build a bridge if you are building a bridge—and not as much to software engineering, with some exceptions (e.g. if you are working with other people’s money). In software, if you don’t know how to do something then start small and iterate. The alternative is tutorial hell, and you can’t learn as effectively without building and shipping yourself.

## On career vision (12)

> One of the main tasks of this course is to start you on the path of creating in some detail your vision of your future...
>
> You will probably object that if you try to get a vision now it is likely to be wrong—and my reply is that from observation I have seen the accuracy of the vision matters less than you might suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting, there are potentially many paths…
>
> You must, as in the case of forging your personal style, find your vision of your future career, and then follow it as best you can.

I also quoted this in talking about <Link href="/my-next-next-next-job">my next, next, next job</Link>. I’m trying to do more of this: envision what I want to learn and work on, despite knowing that it will constantly change.

## On end-user programming (55)

> What is wanted in the long run, of course, is that the man with the problem does the actual writing of the code with no human interface, as we all too often have these days between the person who knows the problem and the person who knows the programming language. This state is unfortunately too far off to do much good immediately, but I would think by the year 2020 it would be fairly universal practice for the expert in the field of application to do the actual program preparation rather than have experts in computers (and ignorant of the field of application) do the program preparation.

I don’t know exactly when Hamming made this prediction. The book was originally published in 1996, but it’s based on a course he taught before that, so let’s say about 30 years ago. The goal of [end-user programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/) that he describes still feels pretty far off in 2023, although lots of people are working on no-code tools and other projects. This is not a field I know much about, but I am interested to learn more!

## On programming as more creative writing, less engineering (57)

> The question arises: "Is programming closer to novel writing than it is to classical engineering?" I suggest yes! Given the problem of getting a man into outer space, both the Russians and Americans did it pretty much the same way, all things considered, and allowing for some espionage. They were both limited by the same firm laws of physics. But give two novelists the problem of writing on "the greatness and misery of man," and you will probably get two very different novels (without saying just how to measure this). Give the same complex problem to two modern programmers and you will, I claim, get two rather different programs.

When I learned to code a couple years ago, one of the things that surprised me most is how much programming fed my English language nerd appetite. For every essay like David Foster Wallace’s [_Authority and American Usage_](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWAuthorityAndAmericanUsage2005.pdf) (which is highly entertaining coverage of "the seamy underbelly of US lexicography"), there is also somewhere an equally pedantic programming essay. Coding really does feel similar to writing a lot of the time, at least for me.

One of my friends whose father is a novelist and uncle is a programmer has told me about long arguments the two brothers have held about which profession is more creative. It would be interesting to hear from people who have been _both_ novelists and programmers for considerable time.

## On giving talks (63)

Hamming wanted to get better at speaking, so he signed up to give a few talks a year as part of IBM training programs. For the topic, he chose _The History of Computing to the Year 2000_ (it was around 1960 when he started giving talks). He ended up learning a lot about the future of computing when preparing for the talks directly, of course, but it also motivated him to stay in tune year round with the latest in the field.

I’ve heard the phrase “talk driven development”—I can’t remember where—to describe the learning that signing up for a talk forces you to do, and I’ve always loved that idea. I gave a [talk on Web accessibility in 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPX0Gk0l6Vo), which helped me build a good foundation there—and a lot of what I learned stuck with me.

## On [the rest of the book]

_I started reading this last week, so more to come._
