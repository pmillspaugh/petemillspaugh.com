Reading books can be like running long distance. They are similar in that when you don’t do it (or aren’t currently), it seems like a tall task. When you’ve only run a few miles, running tens and twenties of mileage seems far off. And when you’ve only read tweets and articles lately, a novel looks friggin’ long. But when you start stacking runs one more mile at a time, suddenly they don’t seem so long. When you read every night before bed, then decide to pick up your book at the odd moment here or there, you finish books quickly.
