  I’ve only planted a seed here. I had a fleeting surge of ideas for this essay,

I started writing somewhat regularly about ten years ago. Writing has been and is many things for me.

## On communicating

I don’t know if “communicating” is the right label for what I mean here. In any case, this is among the most important ways writing impacts me now, which I didn’t see coming.

Writing is helping me mend family trauma and conflict. I can often communicate by writing in ways that I literally can’t by talking. Sometimes the receiver isn’t ready or capable of listening, or I can’t stitch together the words just right. But in writing, I can rewrite, rearrange, reconsider, reorder, etc. And I can leave the words there for whenever the receiver is ready to absorb them.

## On having your antenna up

One reason I’m interested in taking on writing projects—whether a book or a longform nonfiction piece—is that it brings the world to life. I learn about things that otherwise wouldn’t interest me. Like, researching [the geopolitics of internet domains](https://www.dotcom.press/archive/eminent-domains) makes me a whole lot more interested in [tiny islands](https://www.dotcom.press/archive/anguilla) and wars happening across the world. Compounding that sort of intellectual digging over decades would really satisfy me, I think. I’d learn a lot about the world. It’s that [antenna-up](/the-millspaugh-method#having-your-antenna-up) phenomenon I described, riffing on James Somers’s “[More people should write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write).” In 2009, when my brother was 16 and I was 12, an observant friend of ours noted that we’re both observant. Being a writer gives you a reason to be observant. And that makes you _more_ observant.
