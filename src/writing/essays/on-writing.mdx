  I’ve only planted a seed here. I had a fleeting surge of ideas for this essay,
  but I didn’t commit them to the page soon enough. I plan to return to fill
  this in over time.

I started writing somewhat regularly about ten years ago. Writing has been and is many things for me.

## On connecting

I don’t know if “connecting” is the right label for what I mean here. In any case, this is among the most important ways writing impacts me now, which I didn’t see coming.

Writing is helping me mend family trauma and deep conflict. I can often communicate by writing in ways that I literally can’t by talking. Sometimes the receiver isn’t ready or capable of listening, or I can’t stitch together the words just right. But in writing, I can rewrite, rearrange, reconsider, reorder, etc. And I can leave the words there for whenever the receiver is ready to absorb them.
