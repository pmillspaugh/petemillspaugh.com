_Very rough draft opener:_

I wanted to build a website without a web framework as a learning exercise to play with native browser stuff. Then I took it a step further and asked what it'd be like to build a website without any external dependencies whatsoever. No open-source code, no vendor code. Yada, yada, yada.

## Things I missed at some point building this

- nodemon / HMR
  - Restarting my server manually is super annoying
  - But it's kinda fun to build it yourself
  - Although it doesn't totally work. It works well for HTML/CSS updates, I've found, but is more finicky with JS and occasionally crashes.
  - Weird thing I noticed (and still haven't solved about `_next/hmr`)
- TypeScript
  - Tons of careless errors only caught at runtime w/out TS
- React
  - Reusability, duh
  - I missed the component paradigm of markup/styling/logic all co-located
- webpack
  - Canâ€™t just import all my modules into one root and ship that to the browser

## Constraints breed creativity

- ...

## Service workers

- This is probably the most exciting to me of the features I played around with
- So powerful [give examples]
- I am interested in what an abstraction would look like for SPAs
  - next/offline already exists and looks terrific
  - I am thinking a hook for a Next.js page, e.g. useOffline
  - **careful here because I maybe don't want someone to take my useOffline idea!**
