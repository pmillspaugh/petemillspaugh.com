In May I was talking to a friend who had just graduated from a CS undergrad program, and he mentioned that he was creating a website. I asked which web framework he was using. React? Svelte? Something else? Nope, no framework—just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It’s been over two years since I worked on a website without heavy abstractions to guide me, so out of curiosity I opened my editor and created three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `index.js`. Pretty immediately I was annoyed by lack of HMR, so I reached for [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon). Before running `npm i nodemon`, though, I decided to take the experiment a step further and see what it would be like to build a website **without any external dependencies whatsoever**, [literally](https://github.com/pmillspaugh/only-the-platform/blob/main/package.json).

I plan to deploy my sandbox site once I have a critical mass of browser API demos that I think others would find interesting. Open source is awesome, and I’ve missed many libraries while tinkering here, but it’s a lot of fun to _#usetheplatform_.

## Browser APIs I’ve explored

So far I’ve played around with:

- [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
- [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)
- [Network Information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API)
- [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
- [Battery Status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API)
- [Fullscreen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API)

### Service workers

Service workers are the browser feature that I get most excited about. I find the every-website-should-have-a-service-worker argument very compelling. A sensible offline experience, for example, should be a given. I think about this whenever I’m on an airplane and a browser tab that I had already loaded 404s on refresh, especially for static sites. Full disclosure: I am the pot calling the kettle a website without a service worker here (i.e. I haven't implemented any service worker caching strategy in my garden just yet).

I’m also interested in what an abstraction would look like for SPAs. [`next/offline`](https://github.com/hanford/next-offline) exists and looks useful. An even simpler interface like a `useOffline` React hook might be handy to cache recently visited or high-traffic pages.

## Things I’ve missed

I’ve resisted the urge to `npm install` so far, but I’ve missed a lot of libraries, namely nodemon / HMR, TypeScript, React, and Webpack.

### nodemon / HMR

As mentioned up top, restarting my server manually is rather annoying. _But_ it’s an interesting exercise to build automatic server restart from scratch. I’m using `fs.watch` to listen for file events and trigger a server restart whenever a file changes. This quick and dirty approach isn’t perfect, though. It works well for HTML/CSS updates, I’ve found, but it’s more finicky with JS and occasionally crashes. The abriged version looks like this:

```js server.js
import http from "http";
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

let server;
startServer();

function startServer() {
  server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    /* Serve static assets */
  });
  server.listen(process.env.port || 3001, () =>
    console.log("Server listening...")
  );
}

fs.watch(
  path.join(__dirname, "./"),
  { recursive: true },
  (eventType, filename) => {
    if (eventType === "change") {
      console.log("Updated: ", filename);
    }
    server.close(() => {
      console.log("Restarting server...");
      startServer();
    });
  }
);
```

It turns out Node 18 (LTS) has supported this out of the box [since October ’22](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.11.0) with the `--watch` flag, so I ended up replacing the flaky `fs.watch` implementation.

## Browser APIs I'd like to explore

The collection of features that browsers ship out of the box is [vast](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). There are a handful that I’m particularly keen to try out:

- [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
- [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- [Media Capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API)
- [Web Speech](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API)
- [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebGL)
- [Web Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API)

## Where to learn about browser features

There are a lot of _#usetheplatform_ advocates out there _(read: Twitter)_. [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) has a couple fun, relevant episodes:

- [Use The Platform!](https://syntax.fm/show/522/use-the-platform)
- [10 Nifty Browser APIs](https://syntax.fm/show/456/10-nifty-browser-apis)
