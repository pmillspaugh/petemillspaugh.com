In May I was talking to a friend who had just graduated from a CS undergrad program, and he mentioned that he was creating a website. I asked which web framework he was using. React? Svelte? Something else? Nope, no framework—just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It’s been over two years since I worked on a website without heavy abstractions to guide me, so out of curiosity I opened my editor and created three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `index.js`. Pretty immediately I was annoyed by lack of HMR, so I reached for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon" target="_blank">nodemon</a>. Before running `npm i nodemon`, though, I decided to take the experiment a step further and see what it would be like to build a website **without any external dependencies whatsoever**, <a href="https://github.com/pmillspaugh/only-the-platform/blob/main/package.json" target="_blank">literally</a>.

I plan to deploy my sandbox site once I have a critical mass of browser API demos that I think others would find interesting. Open source is awesome, and I’ve missed many libraries while tinkering here, but it’s a lot of fun to _#usetheplatform_.

## Browser APIs I’ve explored

So far I’ve played around with:

- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API" target="_blank">Service Workers</a>
- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API" target="_blank">View Transitions</a>
- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Network_Information_API" target="_blank">Network Information</a>

- <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API" target="_blank">Fullscreen</a>

### Service workers

Service workers are the browser feature that I get most excited about. I find the every-website-should-have-a-service-worker argument very compelling. A sensible offline experience, for example, should be a given. I think about this whenever I’m on an airplane and a browser tab that I had already loaded 404s on refresh, especially for static sites. Full disclosure: I am the pot calling the kettle a website without a service worker here (i.e. I haven't implemented any service worker caching strategy in my garden just yet).

I’m also interested in what an abstraction would look like for SPAs. <a href="https://github.com/hanford/next-offline" target="_blank">`next/offline`</a> exists and looks useful. An even simpler interface like a `useOffline` React hook might be handy to cache recently visited or high-traffic pages.

## Things I’ve missed

I’ve resisted the urge to `npm install` so far, but I’ve missed a lot of libraries, namely nodemon / HMR, TypeScript, React, and Webpack.

### nodemon / HMR

As mentioned up top, restarting my server manually is rather annoying. _But_ it’s an interesting exercise to build automatic server restart from scratch. I’m using `fs.watch` to listen for file events and trigger a server restart whenever a file changes. This quick and dirty approach isn’t perfect, though. It works well for HTML/CSS updates, I’ve found, but it’s more finicky with JS and occasionally crashes. The abriged version looks like this:

```js
import http from "http";
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

let server;
startServer();

function startServer() {
  server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    /* Serve static assets */
  });
  server.listen(process.env.port || 3001, () =>
    console.log("Server listening...")
  );
}

fs.watch(
  path.join(__dirname, "./"),
  { recursive: true },
  (eventType, filename) => {
    if (eventType === "change") {
      console.log("Updated: ", filename);
    }
    server.close(() => {
      console.log("Restarting server...");
      startServer();
    });
  }
);
```

It turns out Node 18 (LTS) has supported this out of the box <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.11.0" target="_blank">since October ’22</a> with the `--watch` flag, so I ended up replacing the flaky `fs.watch` implementation. <a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1707521630585676224" target="_blank">Thanks to Jason Lengstorf</a> for the tip!

## Browser APIs I'd like to explore

The collection of features that browsers ship out of the box is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API" target="_blank">vast</a>. There are a handful that I’m particularly keen to try out:

## Where to learn about browser features

There are a lot of _#usetheplatform_ advocates out there _(read: Twitter)_. <a href="https://syntax.fm/" target="_blank">Syntax.fm</a>—my favorite web dev podcast—has a couple fun, relevant episodes:
