        <strong>Essays</strong> are long-form pieces that I've usually been
        thinking about for a while. They are typically less technical and more
        opinionated than a Show 'n tell.

        <strong>Brainstorms</strong> are raw thought streams that I initially

        answering my questions and pointing out what I was right or wrong about.

      <StyledP>
        This is an experimental (and vulnerable ðŸ˜…) format that I came up with

        <strong>Show n' tells</strong> are write-ups detailing how I built
        something. They aren't typically quite as step-by-step and broadly
        applicable as a classic "tutorial", and they are usually more technical
        with more code snippets than my Essays.

        <strong>TIL</strong> stands for <em>Today I Learned</em>.

      <StyledP>
        TILs are tidbits that I come across and jot down quickly. They may not
        connect to anything I'm currently working on, but if I think something
        is neat enough to share and stash away for later, I'll write a TIL.

        write about that don't neatly fit into another category (Essays, Show n'
        tells, Brainstorms, TILs). A Note could be as small as a Tweet or could
        grow large enough to call for re-potting as an Essay.
