        work at SeedFi, now{" "}

        I am a dev who likes to design and write. My bread 'n butter is
        TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Node, and SQL. In the near-ish term I'd
        like to learn Rust and Three.js,{" "}

      <StyledH2 id="this-site">My digital garden</StyledH2>
      <StyledP>
        This website is a digital garden, which is a bit different than a blog
        where each post is a "finished" work ready for public eyes. Instead,
        writing is made public early on while it's still being cultivated and
        growing.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        I owe most of my gardening inspiration to Maggie Appleton for{" "}

      <StyledP>
        My <Link href="/garden">garden</Link> is organized by writing formats
        and statuses, aka growth stages. I have four writing formats:
      </StyledP>
      <StyledUl>
        <li>Essays</li>
        <li>Brainstorms</li>
        <li>Show 'n tells</li>
        <li>TILs</li>
      </StyledUl>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>Essays</strong> are long-form pieces that I've been thinking
        about and iterating on for a while. They are typically less technical
        and more opinionated than a Show 'n tell.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>Brainstorms</strong> are raw thought streams that I initially
        wrote down without consulting the Internet, letting my train of thought
        run uninterrupted, followed by a debrief answering my questions and
        pointing out what I was right or wrong about. This is an experimental
        (and vulnerable ðŸ˜…) format that I came up with while{" "}
        <Link href="/map-in-the-woods" target="_blank">
          downloading an offline map with poor network connection
        </Link>{" "}
        on a hiking trip.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>Show n' tells</strong> are write-ups detailing how I built
        something. They aren't quite as step-by-step and broadly applicable as a
        classic "tutorial", and they are typically more technical with more code
        snippets than my Essays.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>TIL</strong> stands for <em>Today I Learned</em>. TILs are small
        tidbits that I come across and jot down quickly. They may not connect to
        anything I'm currently working on, but if I think something is neat
        enough to share and stash away for later, I'll write a TIL. Inspired by
        Josh Branchaud's{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til" target="_blank">
          til
        </a>{" "}
        repo.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        Each piece of content also has a status or growth stage, which I
        borrowed directly from Maggie:
      </StyledP>
      <StyledUl>
        <li>Seedlings</li>
        <li>Buddings</li>
        <li>Evergreens</li>
      </StyledUl>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>Seedlings</strong> are young, unrefined ideas that I've just
        plantedâ€”or old, unrefined ideas that need watering. If I am a diligent,
        caring gardener, they'll grow into Buddings and maybe even Evergreens.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>Buddings</strong> are maturing works that I have spent
        considerable time and energy cultivating but have not finished. They are
        teenageers who have outgrown their Seedling status and may someday grow
        into Evergreens.
      </StyledP>
      <StyledP>
        <strong>Evergreens</strong> are complete works that I have edited and
        published as a cohesive whole. They are similar to a traditional blog
        post published at a point in time in that way.
