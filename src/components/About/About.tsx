        I am a dev who likes to design and write. My bread â€™n butter is
        TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Node, and SQL. In the near-ish term Iâ€™d
        like to learn Rust and Web Components,{" "}

      <StyledP>
        This website is a digital garden, which is a bit different than a blog
        where each post is a "finished" work ready for public eyes. Instead,
        writing is made public early on while itâ€™s still being cultivated and
        growing. I owe most of my gardening inspiration to Maggie Appleton for{" "}
        <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/" target="_blank">
          her amazing digital garden
        </a>{" "}
        and{" "}

        </a>
        . Major credit also goes to Swyx for pushing the{" "}

        My <Link href="/garden">garden</Link> is organized by writing formats
        and statuses, aka growth stages. I have six writing formats:
      </StyledP>
      <StyledUl>
        <li>
          <strong>Essays:</strong> long-form pieces that Iâ€™ve usually been
          thinking about for a while. They are typically less technical and more
          opinionated than a Show â€™n tell
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brainstorms:</strong> raw thought streams that I initially
          wrote down without consulting the Internet, followed by a debrief
          answering my questions and pointing out where I was right or wrong.
          This is an experimental (and vulnerable ðŸ˜…) format that I came up with
          while{" "}
          <Link href="/map-in-the-woods" target="_blank">
            downloading a map
          </Link>{" "}
          on a hiking trip
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Show nâ€™ tells:</strong> write-ups detailing how I built
          something. They arenâ€™t typically quite as step-by-step and broadly
          applicable as a classic "tutorial", and they are usually more
          technical with more code snippets than my Essays
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TILs:</strong> stands for <em>Today I Learned</em>. TILs are
          small tidbits that I come across and jot down quickly. They may not
          connect to anything Iâ€™m currently working on, but if I think something
          is neat enough to share and stash away for later, Iâ€™ll write a TIL.
          Inspired by Josh Branchaudâ€™s{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til" target="_blank">
            til
          </a>{" "}
          repo
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notes:</strong> things I want to write about that donâ€™t neatly
          fit into another category. A Note could be as small as a Tweet or
          could grow large enough to re-pot as an Essay
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clippings:</strong> email newsletters that I send every month
          or two (ish). I write about whatâ€™s been on my mind and propagate a
          selection of things Iâ€™ve planted since the last clipping. You can sign
          up to receive clippings in the <a href="#footer">footer</a>
        </li>
      </StyledUl>
      <StyledP>
        Each piece of content also has a status, which I borrowed directly from
        Maggie A.:
      </StyledP>
      <StyledUl>
        <li>
          <strong>Seedlings:</strong> young, unrefined ideas that Iâ€™ve just
          plantedâ€”or old, unrefined ideas that need watering. If I am a
          diligent, caring gardener, theyâ€™ll grow into Buddings and maybe even
          Evergreens
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Buddings:</strong> maturing works that I have spent
          considerable time and energy cultivating but have not finished. They
          are teenagers who have outgrown their Seedling status and may someday
          grow into Evergreens
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evergreens:</strong> complete works that I have edited and
          published as a cohesive whole. They are similar to a traditional blog
          post published at a point in time in that way
        </li>
      </StyledUl>
      <StyledP>
        I quite like metaphors, and Iâ€™ve spent considerable time brainstorming
        my own writing status metaphor to use in place of Maggieâ€™s
        seedling/budding/evergreen. Some noteworthy candidates include
        puddle/lake/ocean, boulder/hill/mountain, raw/half-baked/golden-brown,
        and baby/teenager/adult. As yet nothing resonates with me quite as well
        as the stages of plant growthâ€”it is a garden, after all. Greenery evokes
        a positive feeling, and the metaphor stretches really well: I can water
        my plants (write), prune them (edit), give them some sun (think), or
        even re-pot (a TIL into an Essay, for example). If you are a metaphor
        nerd and/or digital gardener,{" "}
