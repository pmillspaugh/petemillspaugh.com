        I’ve always liked to draw, but I haven’t drawn consistently since I was
        18 or so. Planting this /art page is my way of nudging myself to draw
        more. Inspired by{" "}

      <H2>Elephant on the wall</H2>
      <StyledP>
        Last summer my roommate found this big ole frame on the street in
        Brooklyn (large yellow bicycle below for scale). I stuck it on a wall in
        my room and started drawing this elephant that I took a picture of in
        India. I’m drawing directly on the wall with no canvas or anything,
        which feels rather freeing. It’s a work in progress, as you can see.

      <H2>Monochrome monkey</H2>
      <StyledP>
        That elephant is the most recent art I made that hangs in my apartment.
        This monkey is the oldest art I made that still hangs in my apartment. I
        started painting in ninth grade, and this was the first thing I remember
        working on besides one obligatory still life on day 1.
