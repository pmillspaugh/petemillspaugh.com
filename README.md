## About me

I am a frontend developer with core experience in React/Redux/Node.js, and I am especially excited about Accessibility and Progressive Web Apps. I recently gave a talk on [Web Accessibility for Frontend Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPX0Gk0l6Vo) â€“ let me know what you think!
